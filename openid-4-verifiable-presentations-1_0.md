.# Abstract

This specification defines a protocol for requesting and presenting Verifiable Credentials. 

{mainmatter}

# Introduction

This specification defines a mechanism on top of OAuth 2.0 [@!RFC6749] that enables presentation of Verifiable Credentials as Verifiable Presentations. Verifiable Credentials and Verifiable Presentations can be of any format, including, but not limited to W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model [@VC_DATA], ISO mdoc [@ISO.18013-5], and AnonCreds [@Hyperledger.Indy].

OAuth 2.0 [@!RFC6749] is used as a base protocol as it provides the required rails to build a simple, secure, and developer-friendly Credential presentation layer on top of it. Moreover, implementers can, in a single interface, support Credential presentation and the issuance of Access Tokens for access to APIs based on Verifiable Credentials in the Wallet. OpenID Connect [@!OpenID.Core] deployments can also extend their implementations using this specification with the ability to transport Verifiable Presentations. 

This specification can also be combined with [@!SIOPv2], if implementers require OpenID Connect features, such as the issuance of Self-Issued ID Tokens [@!SIOPv2].

## Requirements Notation and Conventions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [@!RFC2119].

# Terminology

This specification uses the terms "Access Token", "Authorization Request", "Authorization Response", "Client", "Client Authentication", "Client Identifier", "Grant Type", "Response Type", "Token Request" and "Token Response" defined by OAuth 2.0 [@!RFC6749], the terms "End-User", "Entity", "Request Object", "Request URI" as defined by OpenID Connect Core [@!OpenID.Core], the term "JSON Web Token (JWT)" defined by JSON Web Token (JWT) [@!RFC7519], the term "JOSE Header" and the term "Base64url Encoding" defined by JSON Web Signature (JWS) [@!RFC7515], the term "JSON Web Encryption (JWE)" defined by [@!RFC7516], and the term "Response Mode" defined by OAuth 2.0 Multiple Response Type Encoding Practices [@!OAuth.Responses].

This specification also defines the following terms. In the case where a term has a definition that differs, the definition below is authoritative.

Credential:
:  A set of one or more claims about a subject made by a Credential Issuer. Note that the definition of the term "Credential" in this specification is different from that in [@!OpenID.Core].

Verifiable Credential (VC):
:  An Issuer-signed Credential whose authenticity can be cryptographically verified. Can be of any format used in the Issuer-Holder-Verifier Model, including, but not limited to those defined in [@VC_DATA], [@ISO.18013-5] (mdoc) and [@Hyperledger.Indy] (AnonCreds).

W3C Verifiable Credential:
:  A Verifiable Credential compliant to the [@VC_DATA] specification.

Presentation:
:  Data that is presented to a specific Verifier, derived from one or more Verifiable Credentials that can be from the same or different Credential Issuers.

Verifiable Presentation (VP):
:  A Holder-signed Credential whose authenticity can be cryptographically verified to provide Cryptographic Holder Binding. Can be of any format used in the Issuer-Holder-Verifier Model, including, but not limited to those defined in [@VC_DATA], [@ISO.18013-5] (mdoc) and [@Hyperledger.Indy] (AnonCreds).

W3C Verifiable Presentation:
:  A Verifiable Presentations compliant to the [@VC_DATA] specification.

Credential Issuer:
:  An entity that issues Verifiable Credentials. Also called Issuer.

Holder:
:  An entity that receives Verifiable Credentials and has control over them to present them to the Verifiers as Verifiable Presentations.

Verifier:
:  An entity that requests, receives, and validates Verifiable Presentations. During presentation of Credentials, Verifier acts as an OAuth 2.0 Client towards the Wallet that is acting as an OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server. The Verifier is a specific case of OAuth 2.0 Client, just like Relying Party (RP) in [@OpenID.Core].

Issuer-Holder-Verifier Model:
:  A model for exchanging claims, where claims are issued in the form of Verifiable Credentials independent of the process of presenting them as Verifiable Presentation to the Verifiers. An issued Verifiable Credential can (but must not necessarily) be used multiple times.

Holder Binding: 
: Ability of the Holder to prove legitimate possession of a Verifiable Credential. 

Cryptographic Holder Binding:
:  Ability of the Holder to prove legitimate possession of a Verifiable Credential by proving control over the same private key during the issuance and presentation. Mechanism might depend on the Credential Format. For example, in `jwt_vc_json` Credential Format, a Verifiable Credential with Cryptographic Holder Binding contains a public key or a reference to a public key that matches to the private key controlled by the Holder. 

Claim-based Holder Binding:
:  Ability of the Holder to prove legitimate possession of a Verifiable Credential by proofing certain claims, e.g., name and date of birth, for example by presenting another Verifiable Credential. Claim-based Holder Binding allows long term, cross device use of a Credential as it does not depend on cryptographic key material stored on a certain device. One example of such a Verifiable Credential could be a Diploma.

Biometrics-based Holder Binding:
:  Ability of the Holder to prove legitimate possession of a Verifiable Credential by demonstrating a certain biometric trait, such as finger print or face. One example of a Verifiable Credential with biometric Holder Binding is a mobile driving license [@ISO.18013-5], which contains a portrait of the Holder.

VP Token:
: An artifact defined in this specification that contains a single Verifiable Presentation or an array of Verifiable Presentations as defined in (#response-parameters).

Wallet:
:  An entity used by the Holder to receive, store, present, and manage Verifiable Credentials and key material. There is no single deployment model of a Wallet: Verifiable Credentials and keys can both be stored/managed locally, or by using a remote self-hosted service, or a remote third-party service. In the context of this specification, the Wallet acts as an OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server (see [@!RFC6749]) towards the Credential Verifier which acts as the OAuth 2.0 Client.

# Overview 

This specification defines a mechanism on top of OAuth 2.0 to request and present Verifiable Credentials as Verifiable Presentations.

As the primary extension, OpenID for Verifiable Presentations introduces the VP Token as a container to enable End-Users to present Verifiable Presentations to Verifiers using the Wallet. A VP Token contains one or more Verifiable Presentations in the same or different Credential formats.

This specification supports any Credential format used in the Issuer-Holder-Verifier Model, including, but not limited to those defined in [@VC_DATA], [@ISO.18013-5] (mdoc), and [@Hyperledger.Indy] (AnonCreds). Credentials of multiple formats can be presented in the same transaction. The examples given in the main part of this specification use W3C Verifiable Credentials, while examples in other Credential formats are given in (#alternative_credential_formats). 

Implementations can use any pre-existing OAuth 2.0 Grant Type and Response Type in conjunction with this specification to support different deployment architectures.

OpenID for Verifiable Presentations supports scenarios where the Authorization Request is sent both when the Verifier is interacting with the End-User using the device that is the same or different from the device on which requested Credential(s) are stored.

This specification supports the response being sent using a redirect but also using an HTTP POST request. This enables the response to be sent across devices, or when the response size exceeds the redirect URL character size limitation.

Implementations can also be built on top of OpenID Connect Core, which is also based on OAuth 2.0. To benefit from the Self-Issued ID Token feature, this specification can also be combined with the Self-Issued OP v2 specification [@SIOPv2].

Any of the OAuth 2.0 related specifications, such as [@RFC9126] and [@RFC9101], and Best Current Practice (BCP) documents, such as [@RFC8252] and [@I-D.ietf-oauth-security-topics], can be implemented on top of this specification.

## Same Device Flow {#same_device}

Below is a diagram of a flow where the End-User presents a Credential to a Verifier interacting with the End-User on the same device that the device the Wallet resides on.

The flow utilizes simple redirects to pass Authorization Request and Response between the Verifier and the Wallet. The Verifiable Presentations are returned to the Verifier in the fragment part of the redirect URI, when Response Mode is `fragment`. 

Note: The diagram does not illustrate all the optional features of this specification.

Figure: Same Device Flow

(1) The Verifier sends an Authorization Request to the Wallet. It contains a Presentation Definition as defined in [@!DIF.PresentationExchange] that describes the requirements of the Credential(s) that the Verifier is requesting to be presented. Such requirements could include what type of Credential(s), in what format(s), which individual Claims within those Credential(s) (Selective Disclosure), etc. The Wallet processes the Authorization Request and determines what Credentials are available matching the Verifier's request. The Wallet also authenticates the End-User and gathers consent to present the requested Credentials. 

(2) The Wallet prepares the Verifiable Presentation(s) of the Verifiable Credential(s) that the End-User has consented to. It then sends to the Verifier an Authorization Response where the Verifiable Presentation(s) are contained in the `vp_token` parameter.

## Cross Device Flow {#cross_device}

Below is a diagram of a flow where the End-User presents a Credential to a Verifier interacting with the End-User on a different device as the device the Wallet resides on.

In this flow, the Verifier prepares an Authorization Request and renders it as a QR Code. The User then uses the Wallet to scan the QR Code. The Verifiable Presentations are sent to the Verifier in a direct HTTP POST request to a URL controlled by the Verifier. The flow uses the Response Type `vp_token` in conjunction with the Response Mode `direct_post`, both defined in this specification. In order to keep the size of the QR Code small and be able to sign and optionally encrypt the Request Object, the actual Authorization Request contains just a Request URI according to [@!RFC9101], which the wallet uses to retrieve the actual Authorization Request data.

Note: The diagram does not illustrate all the optional features of this specification.

Note: The usage of the Request URI as defined in [@!RFC9101] does not depend on any other choices made in the protocol extensibility points, i.e., it can be used in the Same Device Flow, too.

Figure: Cross Device Flow

(1) The Verifier sends to the Wallet an Authorization Request that contains a Request URI from where to obtain the Request Object containing Authorization Request parameters. 

(2) The Wallet sends an HTTP GET request to the Request URI to retrieve the Request Object.

(2.5) The HTTP GET response returns the Request Object containing Authorization Request parameters. It especially contains a Presentation Definition as defined in [@!DIF.PresentationExchange] that describes the requirements of the Credential(s) that the Verifier is requesting to be presented. Such requirements could include what type of Credential(s), in what format(s), which individual Claims within those Credential(s) (Selective Disclosure), etc. The Wallet processes the Request Object and determines what Credentials are available matching the Verifier's request. The Wallet also authenticates the End-User and gathers her consent to present the requested Credentials. 

(3) The Wallet prepares the Verifiable Presentation(s) of the Verifiable Credential(s) that the End-User has consented to. It then sends to the Verifier an Authorization Response where the Verifiable Presentation(s) are contained in the `vp_token` parameter.

# Scope

OpenID for Verifiable Presentations extends existing OAuth 2.0 mechanisms as following:

* A new `presentation_definition` Authorization Request parameter that uses the [@!DIF.PresentationExchange] syntax is defined to request presentation of Verifiable Credentials in arbitrary formats. See (#vp_token_request) for more details. 
* A new `vp_token` response parameter is defined to return Verifiable Presentations to the Verifier in either Authorization or Token Response depending on the Response Type. See (#response) for more details. 
* New Response Types `vp_token` and `vp_token id_token` are defined to request Verifiable Credentials to be returned in the Authorization Response (standalone or along with a Self-Issued ID Token [@!SIOPv2]). See (#response) for more details.
* A new OAuth 2.0 Response Mode `direct_post` is defined to support sending the response across devices, or when the size of the response exceeds the redirect URL character size limitation. See (#response_mode_post) for more details.
* The [@!DIF.PresentationExchange] `format` parameter is used throughout the protocol in order to enable customization according to the specific needs of a particular Credential format. Examples in (#alternative_credential_formats) are given for Credential formats as specified in [@VC_DATA], [@ISO.18013-5], and [@Hyperledger.Indy].
* A new `client_id_scheme` Authorization Request parameter is defined to enable deployments of this specification to use different mechanisms to obtain and validate metadata of the Verifier beyond the scope of [@!RFC6749].

Presentation of Verifiable Credentials using OpenID for Verifiable Presentations can be combined with the user authentication using [@SIOPv2], and the issuance of OAuth 2.0 Access Tokens.

# Authorization Request {#vp_token_request}

The Authorization Request follows the definition given in [@!RFC6749] taking into account the recommendations given in [@!I-D.ietf-oauth-security-topics].

The Verifier MAY send an Authorization Request as a Request Object either by value or by reference, as defined in the JWT-Secured Authorization Request (JAR) [@RFC9101].

This specification defines a new mechanism for the cases when the Wallet wants to provide to the Verifier details about its technical capabilities to
allow the Verifier to generate a request that matches the technical capabilities of that Wallet.
To enable this, the Authorization Request can contain a `request_uri_method` parameter with the value `post`
that signals to the Wallet that it can make an HTTP POST request to the Verifier's `request_uri`
endpoint with information about its capabilities as defined in (#request_uri_method_post). The Wallet MAY continue with JAR
when it receives `request_uri_method` parameter with the value `post` but does not support this feature.

The Verifier articulates requirements of the Credential(s) that are requested using `presentation_definition` and `presentation_definition_uri` parameters that contain a Presentation Definition JSON object as defined in Section 5 of [@!DIF.PresentationExchange]. Wallet implementations MUST process Presentation Definition JSON object and select candidate Verifiable Credential(s) using the evaluation process described in Section 8 of [@!DIF.PresentationExchange] unless implementing only a credential profile that provides rules on how to evaluate and process [@!DIF.PresentationExchange].

The Verifier communicates a Client Identifier Scheme that indicate how the Wallet is supposed to interpret the Client Identifier and associated data in the process of Client identification, authentication, and authorization using `client_id_scheme` parameter. This parameter enables deployments of this specification to use different mechanisms to obtain and validate Client metadata beyond the scope of [@!RFC6749]. A certain Client Identifier Scheme MAY require the Verifier to sign the Authorization Request as means of authentication and/or pass additional parameters and require the Wallet to process them.

Depending on the Client Identifier Scheme, the Verifier can communicate a JSON object with its metadata using `client_metadata` and `client_metadata_uri` parameters that contain name/value pairs defined in Section 4.3 and Section 2.1 of the OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration 1.0 [@!OpenID.Registration] specification as well as [@!RFC7591]. The parameter names include a term `client` since the Verifier is acting as an OAuth 2.0 Client.

This specification enables the Verifier to send both Presentation Definition JSON object and Client Metadata JSON object by value or by reference.

This specification defines the following new parameters:

`presentation_definition`:
: A string containing a Presentation Definition JSON object. See (#request_presentation_definition) for more details. This parameter MUST be present when `presentation_definition_uri` parameter, or a `scope` value representing a Presentation Definition is not present.

`presentation_definition_uri`:
: A string containing an HTTPS URL pointing to a resource where a Presentation Definition JSON object can be retrieved. This parameter MUST be present when `presentation_definition` parameter, or a `scope` value representing a Presentation Definition is not present. See (#request_presentation_definition_uri) for more details.

`client_id_scheme`: 
: OPTIONAL. A string identifying the scheme of the value in the `client_id` Authorization Request parameter (Client Identifier scheme). The `client_id_scheme` parameter namespaces the respective Client Identifier. If an Authorization Request uses the `client_id_scheme` parameter, the Wallet MUST interpret the Client Identifier of the Verifier in the context of the Client Identifier scheme. If the parameter is not present, the Wallet MUST behave as specified in [@!RFC6749]. See (#client_metadata_management) for the values defined by this specification. If the same Client Identifier is used with different Client Identifier schemes, those occurrences MUST be treated as different Verifiers. Note that the Verifier needs to determine which Client Identifier schemes the Wallet supports prior to sending the Authorization Request in order to choose a supported scheme.

`client_metadata`:
: OPTIONAL. A JSON object containing the Verifier metadata values. It MUST be UTF-8 encoded. It MUST NOT be present if `client_metadata_uri` parameter is present.

`client_metadata_uri`: 
: OPTIONAL. A string containing an HTTPS URL pointing to a resource where a JSON object with the Verifier metadata can be retrieved. The scheme used in the `client_metadata_uri` value MUST be `https`. The `client_metadata_uri` value MUST be reachable by the Wallet. It MUST NOT be present if `client_metadata` parameter is present.

A public key to be used by the Wallet as an input to the key agreement to encrypt Authorization Response (see (#jarm)). It MAY be passed by the Verifier using the `jwks` or the `jwks_uri` claim within the `client_metadata` or `client_metadata_uri` request parameter.

`request_uri_method`: 
: OPTIONAL. A string determining the HTTP method to be used when the `request_uri` parameter is included in the same request. Two case-sensitive valid values are defined in this specification: `get` and `post`. If `request_uri_method` value is `get`, the Wallet MUST send the request to retrieve the Request Object using the HTTP GET method, i.e., as defined in [@RFC9101]. If `request_uri_method` value is `post`, a supporting Wallet MUST send the request using the HTTP POST method as detailed in (#request_uri_method_post). If the `request_uri_method` parameter is not present, the Wallet MUST process the `request_uri` parameter as defined in [@RFC9101]. Wallets not supporting the `post` method will send a GET request to the request URI (default behavior as defined in [@RFC9101]). `request_uri_method` parameter MUST NOT be present if a `request_uri` parameter is not present.

If the Verifier set the `request_uri_method` parameter value to `post` and there is no other means to convey its capabilities to the Wallet, it SHOULD add the `client_metadata` parameter to the Authorization Request. 
This enables the Wallet to assess the Verifier's capabilities, allowing it to transmit only the relevant capabilities through the `wallet_metadata` parameter in the Request URI POST request. If the Verifier uses the `client_id_scheme` parameter in the Request Object, it MUST also add the same `client_id_scheme` value in the Authorization Request.   

The following additional considerations are given for pre-existing Authorization Request parameters:

`nonce`:
: REQUIRED. Defined in [@!OpenID.Core]. It is used to securely bind the Verifiable Presentation(s) provided by the Wallet to the particular transaction. See (#preventing-replay) for details. Values MUST only contain ASCII URL safe characters (uppercase and lowercase letters, decimal digits, hyphen, period, underscore, and tilde).

`scope`:
: OPTIONAL. Defined in [@!RFC6749]. The Wallet MAY allow Verifiers to request presentation of Verifiable Credentials by utilizing a pre-defined scope value. See (#request_scope) for more details.

`response_mode`:
: OPTIONAL. Defined in [@!OAuth.Responses]. This parameter is used (through the new Response Mode `direct_post`) to ask the Wallet to send the response to the Verifier via an HTTPS connection (see (#response_mode_post) for more details). It is also used to request signing and encrypting (see (#jarm) for more details). If the parameter is not present, the default value is `fragment`. 

The following is a non-normative example of an Authorization Request: 

```
  GET /authorize?
    response_type=vp_token
    &client_id=https%3A%2F%2Fclient.example.org%2Fcb
    &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient.example.org%2Fcb
    &presentation_definition=...
    &nonce=n-0S6_WzA2Mj HTTP/1.1
```

The following is a non-normative example of an Authorization Request with a `request_uri_method` parameter (including the additional `client_id_scheme` and `client_metadata` parameters): 

```
  GET /authorize?
    client_id=client.example.org
    &client_id_scheme=x509_san_dns
    &client_metadata=...
    &request_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient.example.org%2Frequest%2Fvapof4ql2i7m41m68uep
    &request_uri_method=post HTTP/1.1
```

## `presentation_definition` Parameter {#request_presentation_definition}

This parameter contains a Presentation Definition JSON object conforming to the syntax defined in Section 5 of [@!DIF.PresentationExchange].

The following is a non-normative example how `presentation_definition` parameter can simply be used to request the presentation of a Credential of a certain type:

<{{examples/request/vp_token_type_only.json}}

The following non-normative example shows how the Verifier can request selective disclosure or certain claims from a Credential of a particular type.

<{{examples/request/vp_token_type_and_claims.json}}

The following non-normative example shows how the Verifiers can also ask for alternative Verifiable Credentials being presented:

<{{examples/request/vp_token_alternative_credentials.json}}

The Verifiable Credential and Verifiable Presentation formats supported by the Wallet should be published in its metadata using the metadata parameter `vp_formats_supported` (see (#as_metadata_parameters)). 

The formats supported by a Verifier may be set up using the metadata parameter `vp_formats` (see (#client_metadata_parameters)). The Wallet MUST ignore any `format` property inside a `presentation_definition` object if that `format` was not included in the `vp_formats` property of the metadata.

Note: When a Verifier is requesting the presentation of a Verifiable Presentation containing a Verifiable Credential, the Verifier MUST indicate in the `vp_formats` parameter the supported formats of both Verifiable Credential and Verifiable Presentation.

## `presentation_definition_uri` Parameter {#request_presentation_definition_uri}

`presentation_definition_uri` is used to retrieve the Presentation Definition from the resource at the specified URL, rather than being passed by value. The Wallet MUST send an HTTP GET request without additional parameters. The resource MUST be exposed without further need to authenticate or authorize. 

The protocol for the `presentation_definition_uri` MUST be HTTPS.

The following is a non-normative example of an HTTP GET request sent after the Wallet received `presentation_definition_uri` parameter with the value `https://server.example.com/presentationdefs?ref=idcard_presentation_request`:

```
  GET /presentationdefs?ref=idcard_presentation_request HTTP/1.1
  Host: server.example.com
```

The following is a non-normative example of an HTTP GET response sent by the Verifier in response to the above HTTP GET request:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "id": "vp token example",
    "input_descriptors": [
        {
            "id": "id card credential",
            "format": {
                "ldp_vc": {
                    "proof_type": [
                        "Ed25519Signature2018"
                    ]
                }
            },
            "constraints": {
                "fields": [
                    {
                        "path": [
                            "$.type"
                        ],
                        "filter": {
                            "type": "string",
                            "pattern": "IDCardCredential"
                        }
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

## Using `scope` Parameter to Request Verifiable Credential(s) {#request_scope}

Wallets MAY support requesting presentation of Verifiable Credentials using OAuth 2.0 scope values.

Such a scope value MUST be an alias for a well-defined Presentation Definition that will be 
referred to in the `presentation_submission` response parameter. 

The specific scope values, and the mapping between a certain scope value and the respective 
Presentation Definition is out of scope of this specification. 

Possible options include normative text in a separate specification defining scope values along with a description of their
semantics or machine readable definitions in the Wallet's server metadata, mapping a scope value to an equivalent 
Presentation Definition JSON object. 

Such definition of a scope value MUST allow the Verifier to determine the identifiers of the Presentation Definition and Input Descriptor(s) in the `presentation_submission` response parameter (`definition_id` and `descriptor_map.id` respectively) as well as the Credential formats and types in the `vp_token` response parameter defined in (#response-parameters).  

It is RECOMMENDED to use collision-resistant scopes values.

The following is a non-normative example of an Authorization Request using the scope value `com.example.IDCardCredential_presentation`, 
which is an alias for the first Presentation Definition example given in (#request_presentation_definition):

```
  GET /authorize?
    response_type=vp_token
    &client_id=https%3A%2F%2Fclient.example.org%2Fcb
    &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient.example.org%2Fcb
    &scope=com.example.healthCardCredential_presentation
    &nonce=n-0S6_WzA2Mj HTTP/1.1
```

## Response Type `vp_token` {#response_type_vp_token}

This specification defines the Response Type `vp_token`.

`vp_token`:
:  When supplied as the `response_type` parameter in an Authorization Request, a successful response MUST include the `vp_token` parameter. The Wallet SHOULD NOT return an OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code, Access Token, or Access Token Type in a successful response to the grant request. The default Response Mode for this Response Type is `fragment`, i.e., the Authorization Response parameters are encoded in the fragment added to the `redirect_uri` when redirecting back to the Verifier. The Response Type `vp_token` can be used with other Response Modes as defined in [@!OAuth.Responses]. Both successful and error responses SHOULD be returned using the supplied Response Mode, or if none is supplied, using the default Response Mode.

See (#response) on how the `response_type` value determines the response used to return a VP Token.

## Passing Authorization Request Across Devices

There are use-cases when the Authorization Request is being displayed on a device different from a device on which the requested Credential is stored. In those cases, an Authorization Request can be passed across devices by being rendered as a QR Code. 

The usage of the Response Mode `direct_post` (see (#response_mode_post)) in conjunction with `request_uri` is RECOMMENDED, since Authorization Request size might be large and might not fit in a QR code.

## `aud` of a Request Object

When the Verifier is sending a Request Object as defined in [@!RFC9101], the `aud` Claim value depends on whether the recipient of the request can be identified by the Verifier or not:

- the `aud` Claim MUST equal to the `issuer` Claim value, when Dynamic Discovery is performed.
- the `aud` Claim MUST be "https://self-issued.me/v2", when Static Discovery metadata is used.

Note: "https://self-issued.me/v2" is a symbolic string and can be used as an `aud` Claim value even when this specification is used standalone, without SIOPv2. 

## Verifier Metadata Management {#client_metadata_management}

The `client_id_scheme` enables deployments of this specification to use different mechanisms to obtain and validate metadata of the Verifier beyond the scope of [@!RFC6749]. The term `client_id_scheme` is used since the Verifier is acting as an OAuth 2.0 Client.

This specification defines the following values for the `client_id_scheme` parameter, followed by the examples where applicable: 

* `pre-registered`: This value represents the [@!RFC6749] default behavior, i.e., the Client Identifier needs to be known to the Wallet in advance of the Authorization Request. The Verifier metadata is obtained using [@!RFC7591] or through out-of-band mechanisms.

* `redirect_uri`: This value indicates that the Verifier's redirect URI is also the value of the Client Identifier. In this case, the Authorization Request MUST NOT be signed, the Verifier MAY omit the `redirect_uri` Authorization Request parameter, and all Verifier metadata parameters MUST be passed using the `client_metadata` or `client_metadata_uri` parameter defined in (#vp_token_request). 

The following is a non-normative example of a request when `client_id` equals `redirect_uri`.

```
  HTTP/1.1 302 Found
  Location: https://client.example.org/universal-link?
    response_type=vp_token
    &client_id=https%3A%2F%2Fclient.example.org%2Fcb
    &client_id_scheme=redirect_uri
    &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient.example.org%2Fcb
    &presentation_definition=...
    &nonce=n-0S6_WzA2Mj
    &client_metadata=%7B%22vp_formats%22:%7B%22jwt_vp%22:%
    7B%22alg%22:%5B%22EdDSA%22,%22ES256K%22%5D%7D,%22ldp
    _vp%22:%7B%22proof_type%22:%5B%22Ed25519Signature201
    8%22%5D%7D%7D%7D
```

* `entity_id`: This value indicates that the Client Identifier is an Entity Identifier defined in OpenID Federation [@!OpenID.Federation]. Processing rules given in [@!OpenID.Federation] MUST be followed. Automatic Registration as defined in [@!OpenID.Federation] MUST be used. The Authorization Request MAY also contain a `trust_chain` parameter. The final Verifier metadata is obtained from the Trust Chain after applying the policies, according to [@!OpenID.Federation]. The `client_metadata` or `client_metadata_uri` parameter, if present in the Authorization Request, MUST be ignored when this Client Identifier scheme is used.

* `did`: This value indicates that the Client Identifier is a DID defined in [@!DID-Core]. The request MUST be signed with a private key associated with the DID. A public key to verify the signature MUST be obtained from the `verificationMethod` property of a DID Document. Since DID Document may include multiple public keys, a particular public key used to sign the request in question MUST be identified by the `kid` in the JOSE Header. To obtain the DID Document, the Wallet MUST use DID Resolution defined by the DID method used by the Verifier. All Verifier metadata other than the public key MUST be obtained from the `client_metadata` or the `client_metadata_uri` parameter as defined in (#vp_token_request). 

The following is a non-normative example of a header and a body of a signed Request Object when Client Identifier scheme is a `did`:

Header

<{{examples/request/request_header_client_id_did.json}}

Body

<{{examples/request/request_object_client_id_did.json}}

* `verifier_attestation`: This Client Identifier Scheme allows the Verifier to authenticate using a JWT that is bound to a certain public key as defined in (#verifier_attestation_jwt). When the Client Identifier Scheme is `verifier_attestation`, the Client Identifier MUST equal the `sub` claim value in the Verifier attestation JWT. The request MUST be signed with the private key corresponding to the public key in the `cnf` claim in the Verifier attestation JWT. This serves as proof of possesion of this key. The Verifier attestation JWT MUST be added to the `jwt` JOSE Header of the request object (see (#verifier_attestation_jwt)). The Wallet MUST validate the signature on the Verifier attestation JWT. The `iss` claim value of the Verifier Attestation JWT MUST identify a party the Wallet trusts for issuing Verifier Attestation JWTs. If the Wallet cannot establish trust, it MUST refuse the request. If the issuer of the Verifier Attestation JWT adds a `redirect_uris` claim to the attestation, the Wallet MUST ensure the `redirect_uri` request parameter value exactly matches one of the `redirect_uris` claim entries. All Verifier metadata other than the public key MUST be obtained from the `client_metadata` or or the `client_metadata_uri` parameter.

* `x509_san_dns`: When the Client Identifier Scheme is `x509_san_dns`, the Client Identifier MUST be a DNS name and match a `dNSName` Subject Alternative Name (SAN) [@!RFC5280] entry in the leaf certificate passed with the request. The request MUST be signed with the private key corresponding to the public key in the leaf X.509 certificate of the certificate chain added to the request in the `x5c` JOSE header [@!RFC7515] of the signed request object. The Wallet MUST validate the signature and the trust chain of the X.509 certificate. All Verifier metadata other than the public key MUST be obtained from the `client_metadata` parameter. If the Wallet can establish trust in the Client Identifier authenticated through the certificate, e.g. because the Client Identifier is contained in a list of trusted Client Identifiers, it may allow the client to freely choose the `redirect_uri` value. If not, the FQDN of the `redirect_uri` value MUST match the Client Identifier.

* `x509_san_uri`: When the Client Identifier Scheme is `x509_san_uri`, the Client Identifier MUST be a URI and match a `uniformResourceIdentifier` Subject Alternative Name (SAN) [@!RFC5280] entry in the leaf certificate passed with the request. The request MUST be signed with the private key corresponding to the public key in the leaf X.509 certificate of the certificate chain added to the request in the `x5c` JOSE header [@!RFC7515] of the signed request object. The Wallet MUST validate the signature and the trust chain of the X.509 certificate. All Verifier metadata other than the public key MUST be obtained from the `client_metadata` parameter. If the Wallet can establish trust in the Client Identifier authenticated through the certificate, e.g. because the Client Identifier is contained in a list of trusted Client Identifiers, it may allow the client to freely choose the `redirect_uri` value. If not, the `redirect_uri` value MUST match the Client Identifier.

To use `client_id_scheme` values `entity_id`, `did`, `verifier_attestation`, `x509_san_dns`, and `x509_san_uri`, Verifiers MUST be confidential clients. This might require changes to the technical design of native apps as such apps are typically public clients.

Other specifications can define further values for the `client_id_scheme` parameter. It is RECOMMENDED to use collision-resistant names for such values.

## Request URI Method `post` {#request_uri_method_post}

This request is handled by the Request URI endpoint of the Verifier.  

The request MUST use the HTTP POST method with the `https` scheme, and the content type `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` and the accept header set to `application/oauth-authz-req+jwt`.

The following parameters are defined: 

`wallet_metadata`:
: OPTIONAL. A String containing a JSON object containing metadata parameters as defined in (#as_metadata_parameters). 

`wallet_nonce`:
: OPTIONAL. A String value used to mitigate replay attacks of the Authorization Request. When received, the Verifier MUST use it as the `wallet_nonce` value in the signed authorization request object. Value can be a base64url encoded, fresh, cryptographically random number with sufficient entropy.  

If the Wallet requires the Verifier to encrypt the Request Object, it SHOULD use the `jwks` or `jwks_uri` parameter within the `wallet_metadata` parameter to pass the public key for the input to the key agreement. Other mechanisms to pass the encryption key can be used as well. If the Wallet requires an encrypted Authorization Response, it SHOULD specify supported encryption algorithms using the `authorization_encryption_alg_values_supported` and `authorization_encryption_enc_values_supported` parameters. 

Additionally, if the `client_id_scheme` value permits signed Request Objects, the Wallet SHOULD list supported cryptographic algorithms for securing the Request Object through the `request_object_signing_alg_values_supported` parameter. Conversely, the Wallet MUST NOT include this parameter if the `client_id_scheme` precludes signed Request Objects.

The following is a non-normative example of a request:

```
  POST /request HTTP/1.1
  Host: client.example.org
  Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

    wallet_metadata=%7B%22vp_formats_supported%22%3A%7B%22jwt_vc_json%22%3A%7B%22alg_values_supported
    %22%3A%5B%22ES256K%22%2C%22ES384%22%5D%7D%2C%22jwt_vp_json%22%3A%7B%22alg_values_supported%22%3A%
    5B%22ES256K%22%2C%22EdDSA%22%5D%7D%7D%7D&
    wallet_nonce=qPmxiNFCR3QTm19POc8u
```

### Request URI Response

The Request URI response MUST be an HTTP response with the content type "application/oauth-authz-req+jwt" and the body being a signed, optionally encrypted, request object as defined in [@RFC9101]. The request object MUST fulfill the requirements as defined in (#vp_token_request).

The following is a non-normative example of a request object:

```json
{
   "client_id": "client.example.org",
   "client_id_scheme": "x509_san_dns",
   "response_uri": "https://client.example.org/post",
   "response_type": "vp_token",
   "response_mode": "direct_post",
   "presentation_definition": {...},
   "nonce": "n-0S6_WzA2Mj",
   "wallet_nonce": "qPmxiNFCR3QTm19POc8u",
   "state" : "eyJhb...6-sVA"
}
```

The Wallet MUST process the request as defined in [@RFC9101]. Additionally, if the Wallet passed a `wallet_nonce` in the POST request, the Wallet MUST validate whether the request object contains the respective nonce value in a `wallet_nonce` claim. If it does not, the Wallet MUST terminate request processing. 

The Wallet MUST extract the set of Authorization Request parameters from the Request Object. The Wallet MUST only use the parameters in this Request Object, even if the same parameter was provided in an Authorization Request query parameter. The Client Identifier value in the `client_id` Authorization Request parameter and the Request Object `client_id` claim value MUST be identical. If the Authorization Request contains a `client_id_scheme` parameter, the `client_id_scheme` Authorization Request parameter and the Request Object `client_id_scheme` claim value MUST be identical. If any of these conditions are not met, the Wallet MUST terminate request processing.

The Wallet then validates the request as specified in OAuth 2.0 [@RFC6749].

### Request URI Error Response

If the Verifier responds with any HTTP error response, the Wallet MUST terminate the process.

# Response {#response}

A VP Token is only returned if the corresponding Authorization Request contained a `presentation_definition` parameter, a `presentation_definition_uri` parameter, or a `scope` parameter representing a Presentation Definition (#vp_token_request).

VP Token can be returned in the Authorization Response or the Token Response depending on the Response Type used. See (#response_type_vp_token) for more details.

If the Response Type value is `vp_token`, the VP Token is returned in the Authorization Response. When the Response Type value is `vp_token id_token` and the `scope` parameter contains `openid`, the VP Token is returned in the Authorization Response alongside a Self-Issued ID Token as defined in [@!SIOPv2].

If the Response Type value is `code` (Authorization Code Grant Type), the VP Token is provided in the Token Response.

The expected behavior is summarized in the following table:

| `response_type` parameter value | Response containing the VP Token |
|:--- |:--- |
|`vp_token`|Authorization Response|
|`vp_token id_token`|Authorization Response|
|`code`|Token Response|

Table 1: OpenID for Verifiable Presentations `response_type` values

The behavior with respect to the VP Token is unspecified for any other individual Response Type value, or a combination of Response Type values.

## Response Parameters {#response-parameters}

When a VP Token is returned, the respective response MUST include the following parameters:

`vp_token`:
: REQUIRED. JSON String or JSON object that MUST contain a single Verifiable Presentation or an array of JSON Strings and JSON objects each of them containing a Verifiable Presentations. Each Verifiable Presentation MUST be represented as a JSON string (that is a Base64url encoded value) or a JSON object depending on a format as defined in Appendix A of [@!OpenID.VCI].  When a single Verifiable Presentation is returned, the array syntax MUST NOT be used.  If Appendix A of [@!OpenID.VCI] defines a rule for encoding the respective Credential format in the Credential Response, this rules MUST also be followed when encoding Credentials of this format in the `vp_token` response parameter. Otherwise, this specification does not require any additional encoding when a Credential format is already represented as a JSON object or a JSON string.

`presentation_submission`:
: REQUIRED. The `presentation_submission` element as defined in [@!DIF.PresentationExchange]. It contains mappings between the requested Verifiable Credentials and where to find them within the returned VP Token. This is expressed via elements in the `descriptor_map` array, known as Input Descriptor Mapping Objects. These objects contain a field called `path`, which, for this specification, MUST have the value `$` (top level root path) when only one Verifiable Presentation is contained in the VP Token, and MUST have the value `$[n]` (indexed path from root) when there are multiple Verifiable Presentations, where `n` is the index to select. The `path_nested` object inside an Input Descriptor Mapping Object is used to describe how to find a returned Credential within a Verifiable Presentation, and the value of the `path` field in it will ultimately depend on the credential format. Non-normative examples can be found further in this section. 

Other parameters, such as `state` or `code` (from [@!RFC6749]), or `id_token` (from [@!OpenID.Core]), and `iss` (from [@RFC9207]) MAY be included in the response as defined in the respective specifications. `state` values MUST only contain ASCII URL safe characters (uppercase and lowercase letters, decimal digits, hyphen, period, underscore, and tilde). For the implementation considerations of a `state` parameter, see (#state_management).

The `presentation_submission` element MUST be included as a separate response parameter alongside the VP token. Clients MUST ignore any `presentation_submission` element included inside a Verifiable Presentation.

Including the `presentation_submission` parameter as a separate response parameter allows the Wallet to provide the Verifier with additional information about the format and structure in advance of the processing of the VP Token, and can be used even with the Credential formats that do not allow for the direct inclusion of `presentation_submission` parameters inside a Credential itself.

The following is a non-normative example of an Authorization Response when the Response Type value in the Authorization Request was `vp_token`: 

```
  HTTP/1.1 302 Found
  Location: https://client.example.org/cb#
    presentation_submission=...
    &vp_token=...
```

The following is a non-normative example of a VP Token containing a single Verifiable Presentation:

<{{examples/response/vp_token_raw_ldp_vp.json}}

The following is a non-normative example of a `presentation_submission` parameter sent alongside a VP Token in the example above. It corresponds to a second Presentation Definition example in (#request_presentation_definition):

<{{examples/response/presentation_submission.json}}

A `descriptor_map` element MUST contain a `path_nested` parameter referring to the actual Credential carried in the respective Verifiable Presentation. 

The following is a non-normative example of a VP Token containing multiple Verifiable Presentations:

<{{examples/response/vp_token_multiple_vps.json}}

The following is a non-normative example of a `presentation_submission` parameter sent alongside a VP Token in the example above. It does not correspond to any Presentation Definition examples in this specification:

<{{examples/response/presentation_submission_multiple_vps.json}}

## Response Mode "direct_post" {#response_mode_post}

The Response Mode `direct_post` allows the Wallet to send the Authorization Response to an endpoint controlled by the Verifier via an HTTP POST request. 

It has been defined to address the following use cases: 

* Verifier and Wallet are located on different devices; thus, the Wallet cannot send the Authorization Response to the Verifier using a redirect.
* The Authorization Response size exceeds the URL length limits of user agents, so flows relying only on redirects (such as Response Mode `fragment`) cannot be used. In those cases, the Response Mode `direct_post` is the way to convey the Verifiable Presentations to the Verifier without the need for the Wallet to have a backend.

The Response Mode is defined in accordance with [@!OAuth.Responses] as follows:

`direct_post`:
: In this mode, the Authorization Response is sent to the Verifier using an HTTP POST request to an endpoint controlled by the Verifier. The Authorization Response parameters are encoded in the body using the `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` content type. The flow can end with an HTTP POST request from the Wallet to the Verifier, or it can end with a redirect that follows the HTTP POST request, if the Verifier responds with a redirect URI to the Wallet.

The following new Authorization Request parameter is defined to be used in conjunction with Response Mode `direct_post`: 

`response_uri`:
: REQUIRED when the Response Mode `direct_post` is used. The Response URI to which the Wallet MUST send the Authorization Response using an HTTP POST request as defined by the Response Mode `direct_post`. The Response URI receives all Authorization Response parameters as defined by the respective Response Type. When the `response_uri` parameter is present, the `redirect_uri` Authorization Request parameter MUST NOT be present. If the `redirect_uri` Authorization Request parameter is present when the Response Mode is `direct_post`, the Wallet MUST return an `invalid_request` Authorization Response error. The `response_uri` value MUST be a value that the client would be permitted to use as `redirect_uri` when following the rules defined in (#client_metadata_management).

Note: The Verifier's component providing the user interface (Frontend) and the Verifier's component providing the Response URI (Response Endpoint) need to be able to map authorization requests to the respective authorization responses. The Verifier MAY use the `state` Authorization Request parameter to add appropriate data to the Authorization Response for that purpose, for details see (#implementation_considerations_direct_post). 

The following is a non-normative example of the payload of a Request Object with Response Mode `direct_post`:

```json
{
   "client_id": "https://client.example.org/post",
   "client_id_scheme": "redirect_uri",
   "response_uri": "https://client.example.org/post",
   "response_type": "vp_token",
   "response_mode": "direct_post",
   "presentation_definition": {...},
   "nonce": "n-0S6_WzA2Mj",
   "state" : "eyJhb...6-sVA
}
```

The following non-normative example of an Authorization Request refers to the Authorization Request Object from above through the `request_uri` parameter. The Authorization Request can be displayed to the End-User either directly (as a link) or as a QR Code:

```
https://wallet.example.com?
    client_id=https%3A%2F%2Fclient.example.org%2Fcb
    &request_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient.example.org%2F567545564
```

The following is a non-normative example of the Authorization Response that is sent via an HTTP POST request to the Verifier's Response Endpoint:

```
  POST /post HTTP/1.1
  Host: client.example.org
  Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

    presentation_submission=...&
    vp_token=...&
    state=eyJhb...6-sVA
```

The following is a non-normative example of an Authorization Error Response that is sent as an HTTP POST request to the Verifier's Response Endpoint:

```
  POST /post HTTP/1.1
  Host: client.example.org
  Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

    error=invalid_request&
    error_description=unsupported%20client_id_scheme&
    state=eyJhb...6-sVA
```

If the Response Endpoint has successfully processed the Authorization Response or Authorization Error Response, it MUST respond with HTTP status code 200.

The following new parameter is defined for use in the response from the endpoint:

`redirect_uri`:
: OPTIONAL. String containing a URI. When this parameter is present the Wallet MUST redirect the User Agent to this URI. This allows the Verifier to continue the interaction with the End-User on the device where the Wallet resides after the Wallet has sent the Authorization Response to the Response Endpoint. It can be used by the Verifier to prevent session fixation ((#session_fixation)) attacks. The Response Endpoint MAY return the `redirect_uri` parameter in response to successful Authorization Responses or for Error Responses.

Note: Response Mode `direct_post` without the `redirect_uri` could be less secure than Response Modes with redirects. For details, see ((#session_fixation)).

The value of the redirect URI is an absolute URI as defined by [@!RFC3986] Section 4.3 and is chosen by the Verifier. The Verifier MUST include a fresh, cryptographically random value in the URL. This value is used to ensure only the receiver of the redirect can fetch and process the Authorization Response. The value can be added as a path component, as a fragment or as a parameter to the URL. It is RECOMMENDED to use a cryptographic random value of 128 bits or more. For implementation considerations see (#implementation_considerations_direct_post).

The following is a non-normative example of the response from the Verifier to the Wallet upon receiving the Authorization Response at the Response Endpoint (using a `response_code` parameter from (#implementation_considerations_direct_post)):

```
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Content-Type: application/json
  Cache-Control: no-store

  {
    "redirect_uri":"https://client.example.org/cb#response_code=091535f699ea575c7937fa5f0f454aee" 
  }
```

If the response does not contain the `redirect_uri` parameter, the Wallet is not required to perform any further steps.

Note: In the Response Mode `direct_post` or `direct_post.jwt`, the Wallet can change the UI based on the Verifier's callback to the Wallet following the submission of the Authorization Response.

## Signed and Encrypted Responses {#jarm}

This section defines how Authorization Response containing a VP Token can be signed and/or encrypted at the application level when the Response Type value is `vp_token` or `vp_token id_token`. Encrypting the Authorization Response can prevent personal data in the Authorization Response from leaking, when the Authorization Response is returned through the front channel (e.g., the browser).

To sign, or sign and encrypt the Authorization Response, implementations MAY use JWT Secured Authorization Response Mode for OAuth 2.0 (JARM) [@!JARM].

This specification also defines how to encrypt an unsigned Authorization Response by extending the mechanisms defined in [@!JARM]. The JSON containing the Authorization Response parameters can be encrypted as the payload of the JWE.

The advantage of an encrypted but not signed Authorization Response is that it prevents the signing key from being used as a correlation factor. It can also be a challenge to establish trust in the signing key to ensure authenticity. For security considerations with encrypted but unsigned responses, see (#encrypting_unsigned_response).

If the JWT is only a JWE, the following processing rules MUST be followed:

- `iss`, `exp` and `aud` MUST be omitted in the JWT Claims Set of the JWE, and the processing rules as per [@!JARM] Section 2.4 related to these claims do not apply.
- The processing rules as per [@!JARM] Section 2.4 related to JWS processing MUST be ignored.

The following is a non-normative example of the payload of a JWT used in an Authorization Response that is encrypted and not signed:

<{{examples/response/jarm_jwt_enc_only_vc_json_body.json}}

The JWT response document MUST include `vp_token` and `presentation_submission` parameters as defined in (#response-parameters).

The key material used for encryption and signing SHOULD be determined using existing metadata mechanisms. 

To obtain Verifier's public key for the input to the key agreement to encrypt the Authorization Response, the Wallet MUST use `jwks` or `jwks_uri` claim within the `client_metadata` request parameter, or within the metadata defined in the Entity Configuration when [@!OpenID.Federation] is used, or other mechanisms.

To sign the Authorization Response, the Wallet MUST use a private key that corresponds to a public key made available in its metadata.

### Response Mode "direct_post.jwt" {#direct_post_jwt}

This specification also defines a new Response Mode `direct_post.jwt`, which allows for JARM to be used with Response Mode `direct_post` defined in (#response_mode_post).

The Response Mode `direct_post.jwt` causes the Wallet to send the Authorization Response using an HTTP POST request instead of redirecting back to the Verifier as defined in (#response_mode_post). The Wallet adds the `response` parameter containing the JWT as defined in Section 4.1. of [@!JARM] and (#jarm) in the body of an HTTP POST request using the `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` content type.

The following is a non-normative example of a response using the `presentation_submission` and `vp_token` values from (#jwt_vc). (line breaks for display purposes only):

<{{examples/response/jarm_jwt_vc_json_post.txt}}

The following is a non-normative example of the payload of the JWT used in the example above before base64url encoding and signing:

<{{examples/response/jarm_jwt_vc_json_body.json}}

## Error Response

The error response follows the rules as defined in [@!RFC6749], with the following additional clarifications:

`invalid_scope`: 

- Requested scope value is invalid, unknown, or malformed.

`invalid_request`:

- The request contains more than one out of the following three options to communicate a requested Credential: a `presentation_definition` parameter, a `presentation_definition_uri` parameter, or a scope value representing a Presentation Definition.
- The request uses the `vp_token` Response Type but does not request a Credential using any of the three options
- Requested Presentation Definition does not conform to the DIF PEv2 specification [@!DIF.PresentationExchange].
- The Wallet does not support the `client_id_scheme` value passed in the Authorization Request.
- The Client Identifier passed in the request did not belong to the Client Identifier scheme indicated in the Authorization Request, or requirements of a certain scheme was violated, for example an unsigned request was sent with Client Identifier scheme `entity_id`.

`invalid_client`:

- `client_metadata` or `client_metadata_uri` parameter defined in (#vp_token_request) is present, but the Wallet recognizes Client Identifier and knows metadata associated with it.
- Verifier's pre-registered metadata has been found based on the Client Identifier, but `client_metadata` parameter is also present.

Usage of `client_metadata` or `client_metadata_uri` parameters with `client_id` that the Wallet might be seeing for the first time is mutually exclusive with the registration mechanism where Self-Issued OP assigns `client_id` to the Verifier after receiving Verifier metadata.

`access_denied`:

- The Wallet did not have the requested Credentials to satisfy the Authorization Request.
- The End-User did not give consent to share the requested Credentials with the Verifier.
- The Wallet failed to authenticate the End-User.

This document also defines the following additional error codes and error descriptions:

`vp_formats_not_supported`:

- The Wallet does not support any of the formats requested by the Verifier, such as those included in the `vp_formats` registration parameter.

`invalid_presentation_definition_uri`:

- The Presentation Definition URL cannot be reached.

`invalid_presentation_definition_reference`:

- The Presentation Definition URL can be reached, but the specified `presentation_definition` cannot be found at the URL.

`invalid_request_uri_method`:

- The value of the `request_uri_method` request parameter is neither `get` nor `post` (case-sensitive).


## VP Token Validation

Verifiers MUST validate the VP Token in the following manner:

1. Determine the number of VPs returned in the VP Token and identify in which VP which requested VC is included, using the Input Descriptor Mapping Object(s) in the Presentation Submission.
1. Validate the integrity, authenticity, and Holder Binding of any Verifiable Presentation provided in the VP Token according to the rules of the respective Presentation format. See (#preventing-replay) for the checks required to prevent replay of a VP.
1. Perform the checks on the Credential(s) specific to the Credential Format (i.e., validation of the signature(s) on each VC).
1. Confirm that the returned Credential(s) meet all criteria sent in the Presentation Definition in the Authorization Request.
1. Perform the checks required by the Verifier's policy based on the set of trust requirements such as trust frameworks it belongs to (i.e., revocation checks), if applicable.

Note: Some of the processing rules of the Presentation Definition and the Presentation Submission are outlined in [@!DIF.PresentationExchange].

# Wallet Invocation {#wallet-invocation}

The Verifier has the choice of the following mechanisms to invoke a Wallet:

- Custom URL scheme as an `authorization_endpoint` (for example, `openid4vp://` as defined in (#openid4vp-profile))
- Domain-bound Universal Links/App link as an `authorization_endpoint`
- no specific `authorization_endpoint`, user scanning a QR code with Authorization Request using a manually opened Wallet, instead of an arbitrary camera application on a user-device (neither custom URL scheme nor Universal/App link is used)

# Wallet Metadata (Authorization Server Metadata) {#as_metadata_parameters}

This specification defines how the Verifier can determine Credential formats, proof types and algorithms supported by the Wallet to be used in a protocol exchange.

## Additional Wallet Metadata Parameters

This specification defines new metadata parameters according to [@!RFC8414].

* `presentation_definition_uri_supported`: OPTIONAL. Boolean value specifying whether the Wallet supports the transfer of `presentation_definition` by reference, with true indicating support. If omitted, the default value is true.
* `vp_formats_supported`: REQUIRED. An object containing a list of name/value pairs, where the name is a string identifying a Credential format supported by the Wallet. Valid Credential format identifier values are defined in Appendix A of [@!OpenID.VCI]. Other values may be used when defined in the profiles of this specification. The value is an object containing a parameter defined below:
    * `alg_values_supported`: OPTIONAL. An object where the value is an array of case sensitive strings that identify the cryptographic suites that are supported. Parties will need to agree upon the meanings of the values used, which may be context-specific. For specific values that can be used depending on the Credential format, see (#alternative_credential_formats). If `alg_values_supported` is omitted, it is unknown what cryptographic suites the wallet supports.

The following is a non-normative example of a `vp_formats_supported` parameter:

```
"vp_formats_supported": {
  "jwt_vc_json": {
    "alg_values_supported": [
      "ES256K",
      "ES384"
    ]
  },
  "jwt_vp_json": {
    "alg_values_supported": [
      "ES256K",
      "EdDSA"
    ]
  }
}
```

`client_id_schemes_supported`:
: OPTIONAL. Array of JSON Strings containing the values of the Client Identifier schemes that the Wallet supports. The values defined by this specification are `pre-registered`, `redirect_uri`, `entity_id`, `did`. If omitted, the default value is `pre-registered`. Other values may be used when defined in the profiles of this specification.

## Obtaining Wallet's Metadata

Verifier utilizing this specification has multiple options to obtain Wallet's metadata:

* Verifier obtains Wallet's metadata dynamically, e.g., using [@!RFC8414] or out-of-band mechanisms. See (#as_metadata_parameters) for the details.
* Verifier has pre-obtained static set of Wallet's metadata. See (#openid4vp-profile) for the example.

# Verifier Metadata (Client Metadata) {#client_metadata}

To convey Verifier metadata, Client metadata defined in Section 2 of [@!RFC7591] is used. 

This specification defines how the Wallet can determine Credential formats, proof types and algorithms supported by the Verifier to be used in a protocol exchange.

## Additional Verifier Metadata Parameters {#client_metadata_parameters}

This specification defines the following new metadata parameters according to [@!RFC7591], to be used by the Verifier:

`vp_formats`:
: REQUIRED. An object defining the formats and proof types of Verifiable Presentations and Verifiable Credentials that a Verifier supports. For specific values that can be used, see (#alternative_credential_formats).
Deployments can extend the formats supported, provided Issuers, Holders and Verifiers all understand the new format.

# Verifier Attestation JWT {#verifier_attestation_jwt}

The Verifier Attestation JWT is a JWT especially designed to allow a Wallet to authenticate a Verifier in a secure and flexible manner. A Verifier Attestation JWT is issued to the Verifier by a party that wallets trust for the purpose of authentication and authorization of Verifiers. The way this trust established is out of scope of this specification. Every Verifier is bound to a public key, the Verifier MUST always present a Verifier Attestation JWT along with the proof of possession for this key. In the case of the `client_id_scheme` `verifier_attestation`, the authorization request is signed with this key, which serves as proof of possession.

A Verifier Attestation JWT MUST contain the following claims:

* `iss`: REQUIRED. This claim identifies the issuer of the Verifier Attestation JWT. The `iss` value MAY be used to retrieve the issuer's public key. How the trust is established between Wallet and Issuer and how the public key is obtained for validating the attestation's signature is out of scope of this specification. 
* `sub`: REQUIRED. The value of this claim MUST be the `client_id` of the client making the credential request.
* `iat`: OPTIONAL. (number). The value of this claim MUST be the time at which the Verifier Attestation JWT was issued using the syntax defined in [RFC7519].
* `exp`: REQUIRED. (number). The value of this claim MUST be the time at which the Verifier Attestation JWT expires using the syntax defined in [RFC7519]. The Wallet MUST reject any Verifier Attestation JWT with an expiration time that has passed, subject to allowable clock skew between systems.
* `nbf`: OPTIONAL. The Verifier Attestation JWT MAY contain an "nbf" (not before) claim that identifies the time before which the token MUST NOT be accepted for processing.
* `cnf`: REQUIRED. This claim contains the confirmation method as defined in [@!RFC7800]. It MUST contain a JWK as defined in Section 3.2 of [RFC7800]. This claim determines the public key for which's corresponding private key the Verifier MUST proof possession of when presenting the Verifier Attestation JWT. This additional security measure allows the Verifier to obtain a Verifier Attestion JWT from a trusted issuer and use it for a long time independent of that issuer without the risk of an advisary impersonating the Verifier by replaying a captured attestation. 

The Verifier Attestation JWT MAY use any claim registered in the "JSON Web Token Claims" registry as defined in [@!RFC7519].

Verifier Attestation JWTs compliant with this specification MUST use the media type `application/verifier-attestation+jwt` as defined in (#va_media_type).

A Verifier Attestation JWT MUST set the `typ` JOSE header to `verifier-attestation+jwt`.

The Verifier Attestation JWT MAY be conveyed in the header of a JWS signed object (JOSE header). 

This specification introduces a JOSE header, which can be used to add a JWT to such a header as follows: 

* `jwt`: This JOSE header MUST contain a JWT. 

In the context of this specification, such a JWT MUST set the `typ` JOSE header to `verifier-attestation+jwt`.

# Implementation Considerations

## Static Configuration Values of the Wallets

This document lists profiles that define static configuration values of the Wallets and defines one set of static configuration values that can be used by the Verifier when it is unable to perform Dynamic Discovery and is not using any of the profiles.

### Profiles that Define Static Configuration Values

The following is a list of profiles that define static configuration values of Wallets:

- [JWT VC Presentation Profile](https://identity.foundation/jwt-vc-presentation-profile/)

### A Set of Static Configuration Values bound to `openid4vp://` {#openid4vp-profile}

The following is a non-normative example of a set of static configuration values that can be used with `vp_token` parameter as a supported Response Type, bound to a custom URL scheme `openid4vp://` as an Authorization Endpoint:

```json
{
  "authorization_endpoint": "openid4vp:",
  "response_types_supported": [
    "vp_token"
  ],
  "vp_formats_supported": {
    "jwt_vp_json": {
      "alg_values_supported": ["ES256"]
    },
    "jwt_vc_json": {
      "alg_values_supported": ["ES256"]
    }
  },
  "request_object_signing_alg_values_supported": [
    "ES256"
  ]
}
```

## Support for Federations/Trust Schemes

Often Verifiers will want to request Verifiable Credentials from a Credential Issuer who is a participant of a federation, or adheres to a known trust scheme, rather than from a specific Credential Issuer, for example, a "BSc Chemistry Degree" Credential from the hypothetical "eduCreds" trust scheme rather than from a specifically named university.

To facilitate this, federations will need to determine how a Credential Issuer can indicate in a Verifiable Credential that they are a member of one or more federations/trust schemes. Once this is done, the Verifier will be able to create a `presentation_definition` that includes this filtering criteria. This will enable the Wallet to select all the Verifiable Credentials that match this criteria and then by some means (for example, by asking the user) determine which matching Verifiable Credential to return to the Verifier. Upon receiving this Verifiable Credential, the Verifier will be able to call its federation API to determine if the Credential Issuer is indeed a member of the federation/trust scheme that it says it is.

Indicating the federations/trust schemes used by a Credential Issuer MAY be achieved by defining a `termsOfUse` property [@!VC_DATA].

Note: [@!VC_DATA] describes terms of use as "can be utilized by a Credential Issuer ... to communicate the terms under which a Verifiable Credential ... was issued."

The following is a non-normative example of the terms of use that may be defined:

```json
{
   "termsOfUse":[
      {
         "type":"<uri that identifies this type of terms of use>",
         "federations":[
            "<list of federations/trust schemes the Credential Issuer asserts it is a member of>"
         ]
      }
   ]
}
```

Federations that conform to those specified in [@OpenID.Federation] are identified by the `type` `urn:ietf:params:oauth:federation`. Individual federations are identified by the Entity Identifier of the trust anchor. If the federation decides to use trust marks as signs of whether an entity belongs to a federation or not then the federation is identified by the `type` `urn:ietf:params:oauth:federation_trust_mark` and individual federations are identified by the Entity Identifier of the trust mark issuer.

Trust schemes that conform to the TRAIN [@TRAIN] trust scheme are identified by the `type` `https://train.trust-scheme.de/info`. Individual federations are identified by their DNS names.

The following is a non-normative example of a `claims` parameter containing a `presentation_definition` that filters VCs based on their federation memberships:

<{{examples/request/vp_token_federation.json}}

This example will choose a Verifiable Credential that has been issued by a university that is a member of the `ukuniversities.ac.uk` federation and that uses the TRAIN terms of use specification for asserting federation memberships.

## Nested Verifiable Presentations

Current version of this document does not support presentation of a Verifiable Presentation nested inside another Verifiable Presentation, even though [@!DIF.PresentationExchange] specification theoretically supports this by stating that the nesting of `path_nested` objects "may be any number of levels deep".

One level of nesting `path_nested` objects is sufficient to describe a Verifiable Credential included inside a Verifiable Presentation.

## State Management {#state_management}

The `state` parameter defined in Section 4.1.1 of [@!RFC6749] may be used by a verifier to link requests and responses. Also see Section 3.6 and Section 5.3.5 of [@RFC6819], and [@I-D.ietf-oauth-security-topics].

When using Response Mode `direct_post`, also see (#security_considerations_direct_post).

## Response Mode `direct_post` {#implementation_considerations_direct_post}

The design of the interactions between the different components of the Verifier (especially Frontend and Response Endpoint) when using Response Mode `direct_post` is at the discretion of the Verifier since it does not affect the interface between the Verifier and the Wallet. 

In order to support implementers, this section outlines a possible design that fulfills the Security Considerations given in (#security_considerations). 

The design is illustrated in the following sequence diagram:

Figure: Reference Design for Response Mode `direct_post`

(1) The Verifier produces a `nonce` value by generating at least 16 fresh, cryptographically random bytes with sufficient entropy, associates it with the session and base64url encodes it.

(2) The Verifier initiates a new transaction at its Response Endpoint. 

(3) The Response Endpoint will set up the transaction and respond with two fresh, cryptographically random numbers with sufficient entropy designated as `transaction-id` and `request-id`. Those values are used in the process to identify the authorization response (`request-id`) and to ensure only the Verifier can obtain the Authorization Response data (`transaction-id`).

(4) The Verifier then sends the Authorization Request with the `request-id` as `state` and the `nonce` value created in step (1) to the Wallet.

(5) After authenticating the End-User and getting her consent to share the request Credentials, the Wallet sends the Authorization Response with the parameters `vp_token`, `presentation_submission` and `state` to the `response_uri` of the Verifier.  

(6) The Verifier's Response Endpoint checks whether the `state` value is a valid `request-id`. If so, it stores the Authorization Response data linked to the respective `transaction-id`. It then creates a `response_code` as fresh, cryptographically random number with sufficient entropy that it also links with the respective Authorization Response data. It then returns the `redirect_uri`, which includes the `response_code` to the Wallet. 

Note: If the Verifier's Response Endpoint does not return a `redirect_uri`, processing at the Wallet stops at that step. The Verifier is supposed to fetch the Authorization Response without waiting for a redirect (see step 8).  

(7) The Wallet sends the user agent to the Verifier (`redirect_uri`). The Verifier receives the Request and extracts the `response_code` parameter.

(8) The Verifier sends the `response_code` and the `transaction-id` from its session to the Response Endpoint. 

* The Response Endpoint uses the `transaction-id` to look the matching Authorization Response data up, which implicitly validates the `transaction-id` associated with the Verifier's session. 
* If an Authorization Response is found, the Response Endpoint checks whether the `response_code` was associated with this Authorization Response in step (6).

Note: If the Verifier's Response Endpoint did not return a `redirect_uri` in step (6), the Verifier will periodically query the Response Endpoint with the `transaction-id` to obtain the Authorization Response once it becomes available. 

(9) The Response Endpoint returns the VP Token and Presentation Submission for further processing to the Verifier. 

(10) The Verifier checks whether the `nonce` received in the Credential(s) in the VP Token in step (9) corresponds to the `nonce` value from the session. The Verifier then consumes the VP Token and invalidates the `transaction-id`, `request-id` and `nonce` in the session.

# Security Considerations {#security_considerations}

## Preventing Replay of the VP Token {#preventing-replay} 

An attacker could try to inject a VP Token (or an individual Verifiable Presentation), that was obtained from a previous Authorization Response, into another Authorization Response thus impersonating the End-User that originally presented that VP Token or the respective Verifiable Presentation.

Implementers of this specification MUST implement the controls as defined in this section to detect such an attack. 

This specification assumes that a Verifiable Credential is always presented with a cryptographic proof of possession which can be a Verifiable Presentation. This cryptographic proof of possession MUST be bound by the Wallet to the intended audience (the Client Identifier of the Verifier) and the respective transaction (identified by the `nonce` parameter in the Authorization Request). The Verifier MUST verify this binding. 

The Verifier MUST create a fresh, cryptographically random number with sufficient entropy for every Authorization Request, store it with its current session, and pass it in the `nonce` Authorization Request Parameter to the Wallet.  

The Wallet MUST link every Verifiable Presentation returned to the Verifier in the VP Token to the `client_id` and the `nonce` values of the respective Authentication Request. 

The Verifier MUST validate every individual Verifiable Presentation in an Authorization Response and ensure that it is linked to the values of the `client_id` and the `nonce` parameter it had used for the respective Authorization Request. If the response contains multiple Verifiable Presentations which do not contain the same nonce value, the response is rejected.

The `client_id` is used to detect the presentation of Verifiable Credentials to a party other than the one intended. This allows Verifiers take appropriate action in that case, such as not accepting the Verifiable Presentation. The `nonce` value binds the Presentation to a certain authentication transaction and allows the Verifier to detect injection of a Presentation in the flow, which is especially important in the flows where the Presentation is passed through the front-channel.

Note: Different formats for Verifiable Presentations and signature/proof schemes use different ways to represent the intended audience and the session binding. Some use claims to directly represent those values, others include the values into the calculation of cryptographic proofs. There are also different naming conventions across the different formats. The format of the respective presentation is determined from the format information in the presentation submission in the Authorization Response.

The following is a non-normative example of the payload of a Verifiable Presentation of a format identifier `jwt_vp_json`:

```json
{
  "iss": "did:example:ebfeb1f712ebc6f1c276e12ec21",
  "jti": "urn:uuid:3978344f-8596-4c3a-a978-8fcaba3903c5",
  "aud": "s6BhdRkqt3",
  "nonce": "343s$FSFDa-",
  "nbf": 1541493724,
  "iat": 1541493724,
  "exp": 1573029723,
  "vp": {
    "@context": [
      "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
      "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/examples/v1"
    ],
    "type": ["VerifiablePresentation"],

    "verifiableCredential": [""]
  }
}
```

In the example above, the requested `nonce` value is included as the `nonce` and `client_id` as the `aud` value in the proof of the Verifiable Presentation.

The following is a non-normative example of a Verifiable Presentation of a format identifier `ldp_vp` without a `proof` property:

```json
{
  "@context": [ ... ],
  "type": "VerifiablePresentation",
  "verifiableCredential": [ ... ],
  "proof": {
    "type": "RsaSignature2018",
    "created": "2018-09-14T21:19:10Z",
    "proofPurpose": "authentication",
    "verificationMethod": "did:example:ebfeb1f712ebc6f1c276e12ec21#keys-1",    
    "challenge": "343s$FSFDa-",
    "domain": "s6BhdRkqt3",
    "jws": "eyJhb...nKb78"
  }
}
```

In the example above, the requested `nonce` value is included as the `challenge` and `client_id` as the `domain` value in the proof of the Verifiable Presentation.

## Session Fixation {#session_fixation}

To perform a Session Fixation attack, an attacker would start the process using a Verifier executed on a device under his control, capture the Authorization Request and relay it to the device of a victim. The attacker would then periodically try to conclude the process in his Verifier, which would cause the Verifier on his device to try to fetch and verify the Authorization Response. 

Such an attack is impossible against flows implemented with the Response Mode `fragment` as the Wallet will always send the VP Token to the redirect endpoint on the same device where it resides. This means an attacker could extract a valid Authorization Request from a Verifier on his device and trick a Victim into performing the same Authorization Request on her device. But there is technically no way for an attacker to get hold of the resulting VP Token. 

However, the Response Mode `direct_post` is susceptible to such an attack as the result is sent from the Wallet out-of-band to the Verifier's Response Endpoint. 

This kind of attack can be detected if the Response Mode `direct_post` is used in conjunction with the redirect URI, which causes the Wallet to redirect the flow to the Verifier's frontend at the device where the transaction was concluded. The Verifier's Response Endpoint MUST include a fresh secret (Response Code) into the redirect URI returned to the Wallet and the Verifier's Response Endpoint MUST require the frontend to pass the respective Response Code when fetching the Authorization Response. That stops session fixation attacks as long as the attacker is unable to get access to the Response Code. 

See (#implementation_considerations_direct_post) for more implementation considerations.

When using the Response Mode `direct_post` without the further protection provided by the redirect URI, there is no session context for the Verifier to detect session fixation attempts. It is RECOMMENDED for the Verifiers to implement mechanisms to strengthen the security of the flow. For more details on possible attacks and mitigations see [@I-D.ietf-oauth-cross-device-security].

## Response Mode "direct_post" {#security_considerations_direct_post}

### Validation of the Response URI

The Wallet MUST ensure the data in the Authorization Response cannot leak through Response URIs. When using pre-registered Response URIs, the Wallet MUST comply with best practices for redirect URI validation as defined in [@I-D.ietf-oauth-security-topics]. The Wallet MAY also rely on a Client Identifier scheme in conjunction with Client Authentication and integrity protection of the request to establish trust in the Response URI provided by a certain Verifier.

### Protection of the Response URI

The Verifier SHOULD protect its Response URI from inadvertent requests by checking that the value of the received `state` parameter corresponds to a recent Authorization Request. It MAY also use JARM [@!JARM] to authenticate the originator of the request. 

### Protection of the Authorization Response Data

This specification assumes that the Verifier's Response Endpoint offers an internal interface to other components of the Verifier to obtain (and subsequently process) Authorization Response data. An attacker could try to obtain Authorization Response Data from a Verifier's Response Endpoint by looking up this data through the internal interface. This could lead to leakage valid Verifiable Presentations containing PII. 

Implementations of this specification MUST have security mechanisms in place to prevent inadvertent requests against this internal interface. Implementation options to fulfill this requirement include: 

* Authentication between the different parts within the Verifier
* Two cryptographically random numbers.  The first being used to manage state between the Wallet and Verifier. The second being used to ensure that only a legitimate component of the Verifier can obtain the Authorization Response data.

## User Authentication using Verifiable Credentials

Clients intending to authenticate the end-user utilizing a claim in a Verifiable Credential MUST ensure this claim is stable for the end-user as well locally unique and never reassigned within the Credential Issuer to another end-user. Such a claim MUST also only be used in combination with the Credential Issuer identifier to ensure global uniqueness and to prevent attacks where an attacker obtains the same claim from a different Credential Issuer and tries to impersonate the legitimate user.

## Encrypting an Unsigned Response {#encrypting_unsigned_response}

If an encrypted Authorization Response has no additional integrity protection, an attacker might be able to alter Authorization Response parameters such as `presentation_submission` and generate a new encrypted Authorization Response for the Verifier, as encryption is performed using the public key of the Verifier which is likely to be widely known. Note this includes injecting a new VP Token. Since the contents of the VP Token are integrity protected, tampering the VP Token is detectable by the Verifier. For details, see (#preventing-replay).

## DIF Presentation Exchange 2.0.0

### Fetching Presentation Definitions by Reference

In many instances the referenced server will be operated by a known federation or other trusted operator, and the URL's domain name will already be widely known. Wallets using this URI can mitigate request forgeries by having a pre-configured set of trusted domain names and only fetching Presentation Definition from these sources. In addition, the Presentation Definitions could be signed by a trusted authority, such as the federation operator.

### JSONPath and Arbitrary Scripting 

Implementers MUST make sure that JSONPath used as part of `presentation_definition` and `presentation_submission` parameters cannot be used to execute arbitrary scripts on a server. This can be achieved, for example, by implementing the entire syntax of the query without relying on the parsers of programming language engine. For details, see Section 4 of [@I-D.ietf-jsonpath-base].

### Filters Property

Implementers should be careful with what is used as a filter property in [@!DIF.PresentationExchange]. For example, when using regular expressions or JSON Schemas as filters, implementers should ensure that computations and resource access are bounded with the security in mind to prevent attacks such as denial of service or unauthorized access.

##  TLS Requirements

Implementations MUST follow [@!BCP195].

Whenever TLS is used, a TLS server certificate check MUST be performed, per [@!RFC6125].

# Privacy Considerations

## Authorization Requests with Request URI

If the Wallet is acting within a trust framework that allows the Wallet to determine whether a 'request_uri' belongs to a certain 'client_id', the Wallet is RECOMMENDED to validate the Verifier's authenticity and authorization given by 'client_id' and that the 'request_uri' corresponds to this Verifier. If the link cannot be established in those cases, the Wallet SHOULD refuse the request or ask the End-User for advise.

If no user interaction is required before sending the request, it is easy to request on a large scale and in an automated fashion the wallet capabilities from all visitors of a website. Even without personally identifiable information (PII) this can reveal some information about users, like their nationality (e.g., a Wallet with special capabilities only used in one EU member state).

Mandatory user interaction before sending the request, like clicking a button, unlocking the wallet or even just showing a screen of the app, can make this less attractive/likely to being exploited.

Requests from the Wallet to the Verifier SHOULD be sent with the minimal amount of information possible, and in particular, without any HTTP headers identifying the software used for the request (e.g., HTTP libraries or their versions). The Wallet MUST NOT send PII or any other data that could be used for fingerprinting to the Request URI in order to prevent user tracking.

# Examples with Credentials in Various Formats {#alternative_credential_formats}

OpenID for Verifiable Presentations is Credential format agnostic, i.e., it is designed to allow applications to request and receive Verifiable Presentations and Verifiable Credentials in any format, not limited to the formats defined in [@!VC_DATA]. This section aims to illustrate this with examples utilizing different Credential formats. Customization of OpenID for Verifiable Presentation for Credential formats other than those defined in [@!VC_DATA] uses extension points of Presentation Exchange [@!DIF.PresentationExchange].

## W3C Verifiable Credentials

### VC signed as a JWT, not using JSON-LD {#jwt_vc}

This section illustrates presentation of a Credential conformant to [@VC_DATA] that is signed using JWS, and does not use JSON-LD.

The Credential format identifiers are `jwt_vc_json` for a W3C Verifiable Credential and `jwt_vp_json` for W3C Verifiable Presentation.

Cipher suites should use algorithm names defined in [IANA JOSE Algorithms Registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/jose/jose.xhtml#web-signature-encryption-algorithms).

#### Example Credential

The following is a non-normative example of the payload of a JWT-based W3C Verifiable Credential that will be used throughout this section:

<{{examples/credentials/jwt_vc.json}}

#### Presentation Request

The following is a non-normative example of an Authorization Request:

<{{examples/request/request.txt}}

The requirements regarding the Credential to be presented are conveyed in the `presentation_definition` parameter. 

The following is a non-normative example of the contents of a `presentation_definition` parameter:

<{{examples/request/pd_jwt_vc.json}}

This `presentation_definition` parameter contains a single `input_descriptor` element, which sets the desired format to JWT VC and defines a constraint over the `vc.type` parameter to select Verifiable Credentials of type `IDCredential`. 

#### Presentation Response

The following is a non-normative example of an Authorization Response:

<{{examples/response/response.txt}}

The following is a non-normative example of the content of the `presentation_submission` parameter: 

<{{examples/response/ps_jwt_vc.json}}

The following is a non-normative example of the payload of the Verifiable Presentation in the `vp_token` parameter provided in the same response and referred to by the `presentation_submission` above:

<{{examples/response/jwt_vp.json}}

Note: The VP's `nonce` claim contains the value of the `nonce` of the presentation request and the `aud` claim contains the Client Identifier of the Verifier. This allows the Verifier to detect replay of a Presentation as recommended in (#preventing-replay).

### LDP VCs

This section illustrates presentation of a Credential conformant to [@VC_DATA] that is secured using Data Integrity, using JSON-LD.

The Credential format identifiers are `ldp_vc` for a W3C Verifiable Credential and `ldp_vp` for W3C Verifiable Presentation.

Cipher suites should use signature suites names defined in [Linked Data Cryptographic Suite Registry](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ld-cryptosuite-registry/).

#### Example Credential

The following is a non-normative example of the payload of a Verifiable Credential that will be used throughout this section:

<{{examples/credentials/ldp_vc.json}}

#### Presentation Request

The following is a non-normative example of an Authorization Request:

<{{examples/request/request.txt}}

The following is a non-normative example of the contents of a `presentation_definition` parameter that contains the requirements regarding the Credential to be presented:

<{{examples/request/pd_ldp_vc.json}}

This `presentation_definition` parameter contains a single `input_descriptor` element, which sets the desired format to LDP VC and defines a constraint over the `type` parameter to select Verifiable Credentials of type `IDCredential`.

#### Presentation Response

The following is a non-normative example of an Authorization Response:

<{{examples/response/response.txt}}

The following is a non-normative example of the content of the `presentation_submission` parameter:

<{{examples/response/ps_ldp_vc.json}}

The following is a non-normative example of the Verifiable Presentation in the `vp_token` parameter provided in the same response and referred to by the `presentation_submission` above:

<{{examples/response/ldp_vp.json}}

Note: The VP's `challenge` claim contains the value of the `nonce` of the presentation request and the `domain` claims contains the Client Identifier of the Verifier. This allows the Verifier to detect replay of a presentation as recommended in (#preventing-replay). 

## AnonCreds

AnonCreds is a Credential format defined as part of the Hyperledger Indy project [@Hyperledger.Indy].

To be able to request AnonCreds, there needs to be a set of identifiers for Verifiable Credentials, Verifiable Presentations ("proofs" in Indy terminology) and crypto schemes.

Credential format identifier is `ac_vc` for a Credential, and `ac_vp` for a Presentation.

Identifier for a CL-signature crypto scheme used in the examples in this section is `CLSignature2019`.

### Example Credential

The following is a non-normative example of an AnonCred Credential that will be used throughout this section. 

<{{examples/credentials/ac_vc.json}}

The most important parts for the purpose of this section are `scheme_id` parameter and `values` parameter that contains the actual End-User claims. 

### Presentation Request 

#### Request Example {#anoncreds_request}

The following is a non-normative example of an Authorization Request:

<{{examples/request/request.txt}}

The following is a non-normative example of the content of the `presentation_definition` parameter:

<{{examples/request/pd_ac_vc.json}}

The `format` object in the `input_descrioptor` element uses the format identifier `ac_vc` as defined above and sets the `proof_type` to `CLSignature2019` to denote this descriptor requires a Credential in AnonCreds format signed with a CL signature (Camenisch-Lysyanskaya signature). The rest of the expressions operate on the AnonCreds JSON structure.

The `constraints` object requires the selected Credential to conform with the schema definition `did:indy:idu:test:3QowxFtwciWceMFr7WbwnM:2:BasicScheme:0\\.1`, which is denoted as a constraint over the AnonCred's `schema_id` parameter. 

#### Request Example with Selective Release of Claims

The next example leverages the AnonCreds' capabilities for selective release by requesting a subset of the claims in the Credential to be disclosed to the Verifier.

A non-normative example of an Authorization Request would look the same as in (#anoncreds_request). 

The following is a non-normative example of the difference is in the `presentation_definition` parameter:

<{{examples/request/pd_ac_vc_sd.json}}

This example is identic to the previous one with the following exceptions: It sets the element `limit_disclosure` of the constraint to `require` and adds two more constraints for the individual claims `given_name` and `family_name`. Since such claims are stored underneath a `values` container in an AnonCred, `values` is part of the path to identify the respective claims. 

### Presentation Response

A non-normative example of the Authorization Response would look the same as in the examples of other Credential formats. It would contain the `presentation_submission` and `vp_token` parameters.

The following is a non-normative example of the content of the `presentation_submission` parameter:

<{{examples/response/ps_ac_vc_sd.json}}

The `descriptor_map` refers to the `input_descriptor` element with an identifier `id_credential` and tells the Verifier that there is a proof of AnonCred Credential (`format` is `ac_vp`) directly in the vp_token (path is the root designated by `$`). Furthermore, it indicates using `path_nested` parameter that the user claims can be found embedded in the proof underneath `requested_proof.revealed_attr_groups.id_card_credential`.

The following is the content of the `presentation_definition` parameter:

<{{examples/response/ac_vp_sd.json}}

## Mobile Documents or mdocs (ISO/IEC 18013 and ISO/IEC 23220 series)

ISO/IEC 18013-5:2021 [@ISO.18013-5] defines a mobile driving license (mDL) Credential in the mobile document (mdoc) format. Although ISO/IEC 18013-5:2021 [@ISO.18013-5] is specific to mobile driving licenses (mDLs), the Credential format can be utilized with any type of Credential (or mdoc document types). The ISO/IEC 23220 series has extracted components from ISO/IEC 18013-5:2021 [@ISO.18013-5] and ISO/IEC TS 18013-7 [@ISO.18013-7] that are common across document types to facilitate the profiling of the specification for other document types. The core data structures are shared between ISO/IEC 18013-5:2021 [@ISO.18013-5], ISO/IEC 23220-2 [@ISO.23220-2], ISO/IEC 23220-4 [@ISO.23220-4] which are encoded in CBOR and secured using COSE_Sign1.

The Credential format identifier for Credentials in the mdoc format is `mso_mdoc`.

ISO/IEC TS 18013-7 Annex B [@ISO.18013-7] and ISO/IEC 23220-4 [@ISO.23220-4] Annex C define a profile of OID4VP for requesting and presenting Credentials in the mdoc format.

The profile includes the following elements:

* Rules for the `presentation_definition` Authorization Request parameter.
* Rules for the `presentation_submission` Authorization Response parameter.
* Wallet invocation using the `mdoc-openid4vp://` custom URI scheme.
* Defines the OID4VP-specific `Handover` CBOR structure and how OID4VP Authorization Request and Request Object parameters apply to the `SessionTranscript` CBOR structure and `DeviceResponse` CBOR structure as specified in ISO/IEC 18013-5 [@ISO.18013-5] and ISO/IEC 23220-4 [@ISO.23220-4].
* Required Wallet and Verifier Metadata parameters and their values.
* Additional restrictions on Authorization Request and Authorization Response parameters to ensure compliance with ISO/IEC TS 18013-7 [@ISO.18013-7] and ISO/IEC 23220-4 [@ISO.23220-4]. For instance, to comply with ISO/IEC TS 18013-7 [@ISO.18013-7], only the same-device flow is supported, the `request_uri` Authorization Request parameter is required, and the Authorization Response has to be encrypted.

### Presentation Request

See ISO/IEC TS 18013-7 Annex B [@ISO.18013-7] and ISO/IEC 23220-4 Annex C [@ISO.23220-4] for the latest examples on how to use the `presentation_definition` parameter for requesting Credentials in the mdoc format.

### Presentation Response

The VP Token contains the base64url encoded `DeviceResponse` CBOR structure as defined in ISO/IEC 18013-5 [@ISO.18013-5] or ISO/IEC 23220-4 [@ISO.23220-4]. Essentially, the `DeviceResponse` CBOR structure contains a signature or MAC over the `SessionTranscript` CBOR structure including the OID4VP-specific `Handover` CBOR structure.

See ISO/IEC TS 18013-7 Annex B [@ISO.18013-7] and ISO/IEC 23220-4 Annex C [@ISO.23220-4] for the latest examples on how to use the `presentation_submission` parameter and how to generate the Authorizaton Response for presenting Credentials in the mdoc format.

## IETF SD-JWT VC

This section defines how Credentials complying with [@!I-D.ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc] can be presented to the Verifier using this specification.

### Format Identifier

The Credential format identifier is `vc+sd-jwt`.

#### Example Credential

The following is a non-normative example of the unsecured payload of an IETF SD-JWT VC that will be used throughout this section:

<{{examples/credentials/sd_jwt_vc_unsecured.json}}

The following is a non-normative example of an IETF SD-JWT VC using the unsecured payload above, containing claims that are selectively disclosable.

<{{examples/credentials/sd_jwt_vc.json}}

The following are disclosures belonging to the claims from the example above.

__Claim `given_name`__:

 * SHA-256 Hash: `jsu9yVulwQQlhFlM_3JlzMaSFzglhQG0DpfayQwLUK4`
 * Disclosure:\
`WyIyR0xDNDJzS1F2ZUNmR2ZyeU5STjl3IiwgImdpdmVuX25hbWUiLCAiSm9o`\
`biJd`
 * Contents:
`["2GLC42sKQveCfGfryNRN9w", "given_name", "John"]`


__Claim `family_name`__:

 * SHA-256 Hash: `TGf4oLbgwd5JQaHyKVQZU9UdGE0w5rtDsrZzfUaomLo`
 * Disclosure:\
`WyJlbHVWNU9nM2dTTklJOEVZbnN4QV9BIiwgImZhbWlseV9uYW1lIiwgIkRv`\
`ZSJd`
 * Contents:
`["eluV5Og3gSNII8EYnsxA_A", "family_name", "Doe"]`


__Claim `birthdate`__:

 * SHA-256 Hash: `tiTngp9_jhC389UP8_k67MXqoSfiHq3iK6o9un4we_Y`
 * Disclosure:\
`WyI2SWo3dE0tYTVpVlBHYm9TNXRtdlZBIiwgImJpcnRoZGF0ZSIsICIxOTQw`\
`LTAxLTAxIl0`
 * Contents:
`["6Ij7tM-a5iVPGboS5tmvVA", "birthdate", "1940-01-01"]`

### Verifier Metadata

The `format` value in the `vp_formats` parameter of the Verifier metadata MUST have the key `vc+sd-jwt`, and the value is an object consisting of the following name/value pairs:

* `sd-jwt_alg_values`: OPTIONAL. A JSON array containing identifiers of cryptographic algorithms the Verifier supports for signing of an Issuer-signed JWT of an SD-JWT. If present, the `alg` JOSE header (as defined in [@!RFC7515]) of the Issuer-signed JWT of the presented SD-JWT MUST match one of the array values.
* `kb-jwt_alg_values`: OPTIONAL. A JSON array containing identifiers of cryptographic algorithms the Verifier supports for signing of a Key Binding JWT (KB-JWT). If present, the `alg` JOSE header (as defined in [@!RFC7515]) of the presented KB-JWT MUST match one of the array values.

The following is a non-normative example of `client_metadata` request parameter value in a request to present an IETF SD-JWT VC.

<{{examples/client_metadata/sd_jwt_vc_verifier_metadata.json}}

### Presentation Request

The following is a non-normative example of an Authorization Request:

<{{examples/request/request.txt}}

The following is a non-normative example of the contents of a `presentation_definition` parameter that contains the requirements regarding the Credential to be presented:

<{{examples/request/pd_sd_jwt_vc.json}}

The presentation of an IETF SD-JWT VC is requested by adding an object named `vc+sd-jwt` to the `format` object of an `input_descriptor`. The `input_descriptor` value is applied to the unsecured payload of the IETF SD-JWT VC which correspond to the disclosures of the presented SD-JWT VC.

Setting `limit_disclosure` property defined in [@!DIF.PresentationExchange] to `required` enables selective release by instructing the Wallet to submit only the disclosures for the matching claims specified in the fields array. The unsecured payload of an IETF SD-JWT VC is used to perform the matching.

### Presentation Response

A non-normative example of the Authorization Response would look the same as in the examples of other Credential formats in this Annex.

The following is a non-normative example of the content of the `presentation_submission` parameter:

<{{examples/response/ps_sd_jwt_vc.json}}

The following is a non-normative example of the `vp_token` parameter provided in the same response and referred to by the `presentation_submission` above:

<{{examples/response/token_response_vp_token_sd_jwt_vc.txt}}

In this example the `vp_token` contains only the disclosures for the claims specified in the `presentation_submission`, along with a Key Binding JWT.

The following is a non-normative example of the unsecured payload of the Key Binding JWT.

<{{examples/response/kb_jwt_unsecured.json}}

Note: The Key Binding JWT `nonce` claim contains the value of the `nonce` from the authorization request, and the `aud` claim contains the Client Identifier of the Verifier.

## Combining this specification with SIOPv2

This section shows how SIOP and OpenID for Verifiable Presentations can be combined to present Verifiable Credentials and pseudonymously authenticate an end-user using subject controlled key material.

### Request {#siop_request}

The following is a non-normative example of a request that combines this specification and [@!SIOPv2].

```
  GET /authorize?
    response_type=vp_token%20id_token
    &scope=openid
    &id_token_type=subject_signed
    &client_id=https%3A%2F%2Fclient.example.org%2Fcb
    &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient.example.org%2Fcb
    &presentation_definition=...
    &nonce=n-0S6_WzA2Mj HTTP/1.1
  Host: wallet.example.com
```

The differences to the example requests in the previous sections are:

* `response_type` is set to `vp_token id_token`. This means the Wallet returns the `presentation_submission` and `vp_token` parameters in the same response as the `id_token` parameter as described in (#response).
* The request includes the `scope` parameter with value `openid` making this an OpenID Connect request. Additionally, the request also contains the parameter `id_token_type` with value `subject_signed` requesting a Self-Issuer ID Token, i.e., the request is a SIOP request.

### Response

The following is a non-normative example of a response sent upon receiving a request provided in (#siop_request):

```
  HTTP/1.1 302 Found
  Location: https://client.example.org/cb#
    id_token=
    &presentation_submission=...
    &vp_token=...
```

In addition to the `presentation_submission` and `vp_token`, it also contains an `id_token`.

The following is a non-normative example of the payload of a Self-Issued ID Token [@!SIOPv2] contained in the above response:

```json
{
  "iss": "did:example:NzbLsXh8uDCcd6MNwXF4W7noWXFZAfHkxZsRGC9Xs",
  "sub": "did:example:NzbLsXh8uDCcd6MNwXF4W7noWXFZAfHkxZsRGC9Xs",
  "aud": "https://client.example.org/cb",
  "nonce": "n-0S6_WzA2Mj",
  "exp": 1311281970,
  "iat": 1311280970
}
```

Note: The `nonce` and `aud` are set to the `nonce` of the request and the Client Identifier of the Verifier, respectively, in the same way as for the Verifier, Verifiable Presentations to prevent replay.
