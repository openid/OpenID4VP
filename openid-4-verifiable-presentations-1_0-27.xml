<section anchor="introduction"><name>Introduction</name>
<t>This specification defines a mechanism on top of OAuth 2.0 <xref target="RFC6749"></xref> for requesting and delivering Presentations of Credentials. Credentials and Presentations can be of any format, including, but not limited to W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model <xref target="VC_DATA"></xref>, ISO mdoc <xref target="ISO.18013-5"></xref>, IETF SD-JWT VC <xref target="I-D.ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc"></xref>, and AnonCreds <xref target="Hyperledger.AnonCreds"></xref>.</t>
<t>OAuth 2.0 <xref target="RFC6749"></xref> is used as a base protocol as it provides the required rails to build a simple, secure, and developer-friendly Credential presentation layer on top of it. Moreover, implementers can, in a single interface, support Credential presentation and the issuance of Access Tokens for access to APIs based on Credentials in the Wallet. OpenID Connect <xref target="OpenID.Core"></xref> deployments can also extend their implementations using this specification with the ability to transport Credential Presentations.</t>
<t>This specification can also be combined with <xref target="SIOPv2"></xref>, if implementers require OpenID Connect features, such as the issuance of Self-Issued ID Tokens <xref target="SIOPv2"></xref>.</t>
<t>Additionally, it defines how to use OpenID4VP in conjunction with the Digital Credentials API (DC API) <xref target="W3C.Digital_Credentials_API"></xref>. See section <xref target="dc_api"></xref> for all requirements applicable to implementers of OpenID4VP over the DC API.</t>

<section anchor="requirements-notation-and-conventions"><name>Requirements Notation and Conventions</name>
<t>The key words &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;SHALL&quot;, &quot;SHALL NOT&quot;, &quot;SHOULD&quot;, &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;NOT RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;MAY&quot;, and &quot;OPTIONAL&quot; in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 <xref target="RFC2119"></xref> <xref target="RFC8174"></xref> when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.</t>

<section anchor="terminology"><name>Terminology</name>
<t>This specification uses the terms &quot;Access Token&quot;, &quot;Authorization Request&quot;, &quot;Authorization Response&quot;, &quot;Client&quot;, &quot;Client Authentication&quot;, &quot;Client Identifier&quot;, &quot;Grant Type&quot;, &quot;Response Type&quot;, &quot;Token Request&quot; and &quot;Token Response&quot; defined by OAuth 2.0 <xref target="RFC6749"></xref>, the terms &quot;End-User&quot; and &quot;Entity&quot; as defined by OpenID Connect Core <xref target="OpenID.Core"></xref>, the terms &quot;Request Object&quot; and &quot;Request URI&quot; as defined by <xref target="RFC9101"></xref>, the term &quot;JSON Web Token (JWT)&quot; defined by JSON Web Token (JWT) <xref target="RFC7519"></xref>, the term &quot;JOSE Header&quot; defined by JSON Web Signature (JWS) <xref target="RFC7515"></xref>, the term &quot;JSON Web Encryption (JWE)&quot; defined by <xref target="RFC7516"></xref>, and the term &quot;Response Mode&quot; defined by OAuth 2.0 Multiple Response Type Encoding Practices <xref target="OAuth.Responses"></xref>.</t>
<t>Base64url-encoded denotes the URL-safe base64 encoding without padding defined in Section 2 of <xref target="RFC7515"></xref>.</t>
<t>This specification also defines the following terms. In the case where a term has a definition that differs, the definition below is authoritative.</t>

<dl spacing="compact">
<dt>Biometrics-based Holder Binding:</dt>
<dd>Ability of the Holder to prove legitimate possession of a Credential by demonstrating a certain biometric trait, such as a fingerprint or face. One example of a Credential with biometric Holder Binding is a mobile driving license <xref target="ISO.18013-5"></xref>, which contains a portrait of the Holder.</dd>
<dt>Claims-based Holder Binding:</dt>
<dd>Ability of the Holder to prove legitimate possession of a Credential by proving certain claims, e.g., name and date of birth, for example by presenting another Credential. Claims-based Holder Binding allows long-term, cross-device use of a Credential as it does not depend on cryptographic key material stored on a certain device. One example of such a Credential could be a Diploma.</dd>
<dt>Credential:</dt>
<dd>A set of one or more claims about a subject made by a Credential Issuer. In this specification, Credentials are usually Verifiable Credentials (defined below). Note that the definition of the term “Credential” in this specification is different from that in <xref target="OpenID.Core"></xref>.</dd>
<dt>Credential Format Identifier:</dt>
<dd>An identifier to denote a specific Credential Format in the context of this specification. This identifier implies the use of parameters specific to the respective Credential Format.</dd>
<dt>Credential Issuer:</dt>
<dd>An entity that issues Credentials. Also called Issuer.</dd>
<dt>Cryptographic Holder Binding:</dt>
<dd>Ability of the Holder to prove legitimate possession of a Credential by proving control over the same private key during the issuance and presentation. Mechanism might depend on the Credential Format. For example, in jwt_vc_json Credential Format, a Credential with Cryptographic Holder Binding contains a public key or a reference to a public key that matches to the private key controlled by the Holder.</dd>
<dt>Digital Credentials API:</dt>
<dd>The Digital Credentials API (DC API) refers to the W3C Digital Credentials API <xref target="W3C.Digital_Credentials_API"></xref> on the Web Platform and its equivalent native APIs on App Platforms (such as Credential Manager on Android).</dd>
<dt>Holder:</dt>
<dd>An entity that receives Credentials and has control over them to present them to the Verifiers as Presentations.</dd>
<dt>Holder Binding or Key Binding:</dt>
<dd>Ability of the Holder to prove legitimate possession of a Credential.</dd>
<dt>Issuer-Holder-Verifier Model:</dt>
<dd>A model for exchanging claims, where claims are issued in the form of Credentials independent of the process of presenting them as Presentations to the Verifiers. An issued Credential may be used multiple times.</dd>
<dt>Origin:</dt>
<dd>An identifier for the calling website or native application, asserted by the web or app platform. A web origin is the combination of a scheme/protocol, host, and port, with port being omitted when it matches the default port of the scheme. An app platform may use a linked web origin, or use a platform-specific URI for the app origin.</dd>
</dl>
<t>For example, the verifier for the organization MyExampleOrg is served from <eref target="https://verify.example.com">https://verify.example.com</eref>. The web origin is <tt>https://verify.example.com</tt> with <tt>https</tt> being the scheme, <tt>verify.example.com</tt> being the host, and the port is not explicitly included as <tt>443</tt> is the default port for the protocol <tt>https</tt>. The native applications origin on some platforms will also be <tt>https://verify.example.com</tt> and on other platforms, may be <tt>platform:pkg-key-hash:Z4OFzVVSZrzTRa3eg79hUuHy12MVW0vzPDf4q4zaPs0</tt>.</t>

<dl spacing="compact">
<dt>Presentation:</dt>
<dd>Data that is presented to a specific Verifier, derived from a Credential. In this specification, Presentations are usually Verifiable Presentations including Holder Binding (as defined below), but may also be Presentations without Holder Binding (discussed in <xref target="nkb-credentials"></xref>).</dd>
<dt>VP Token:</dt>
<dd>An artifact containing one or more Presentations returned as a response to an Authorization Request. The structure of VP Tokens is defined in <xref target="response-parameters"></xref>.</dd>
<dt>Verifier:</dt>
<dd>An entity that requests, receives, and validates Presentations. The Verifier is a specific case of OAuth 2.0 Client, just like a Relying Party (RP) in <xref target="OpenID.Core"></xref>.</dd>
<dt>Verifiable Credential (VC):</dt>
<dd>An Issuer-signed Credential whose authenticity can be cryptographically verified. Can be of any format used in the Issuer-Holder-Verifier Model, including, but not limited to those defined in <xref target="VC_DATA"></xref> (VCDM), <xref target="ISO.18013-5"></xref> (mdoc), <xref target="I-D.ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc"></xref> (SD-JWT VC), and <xref target="Hyperledger.AnonCreds"></xref> (AnonCreds).</dd>
<dt>Verifiable Presentation (VP):</dt>
<dd>A Presentation with a cryptographic proof of Holder Binding. Can be of any format used in the Issuer-Holder-Verifier Model, including, but not limited to those defined in <xref target="VC_DATA"></xref> (VCDM), <xref target="ISO.18013-5"></xref> (mdoc), <xref target="I-D.ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc"></xref> (SD-JWT VC), and <xref target="Hyperledger.AnonCreds"></xref> (AnonCreds).</dd>
<dt>Wallet:</dt>
<dd>An entity used by the Holder to receive, store, present, and manage Credentials and key material. There is no single deployment model of a Wallet: Credentials and keys can both be stored/managed locally, or by using a remote self-hosted service, or a remote third-party service.</dd>
</dl>

<section anchor="overview"><name>Overview</name>
<t>This specification defines a mechanism to request and present Credentials as Presentations. The baseline of the protocol uses HTTPS messages and redirects as defined in OAuth 2.0. Additionally, the specification defines a separate mechanism where OpenID4VP messages are sent and received over the Digital Credentials API (DC API) <xref target="W3C.Digital_Credentials_API"></xref> instead of HTTPS messages and redirects.</t>
<t>As the primary extension, OpenID for Verifiable Presentations introduces the new response type <tt>vp_token</tt>, which allows Verifier to request and receive Verifiable Presentations and Presentations in a container designated as VP Token. A VP Token contains one or more Verifiable Presentations and Presentations in the same or different Credential formats. Consequently, the result of a OpenID4VP interaction is one or more Verifiable Presentations and Presentations instead of an Access Token.</t>
<t>This specification supports any Credential format used in the Issuer-Holder-Verifier Model, including, but not limited to those defined in <xref target="VC_DATA"></xref> (VCDM), <xref target="ISO.18013-5"></xref> (mdoc), <xref target="I-D.ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc"></xref> (SD-JWT VC), and <xref target="Hyperledger.AnonCreds"></xref> (AnonCreds). Credentials of multiple formats can be presented in the same transaction. The examples given in the main part of this specification use W3C Verifiable Credentials, while examples in other Credential formats are given in <xref target="format_specific_parameters"></xref>.</t>
<t>OpenID for Verifiable Presentations supports scenarios where the Authorization Request is sent both when the Verifier is interacting with the End-User using the device that is the same or different from the device on which requested Credential(s) are stored.</t>
<t>This specification supports the response being sent using a redirect but also using an HTTP POST request. This enables the response to be sent across devices, or when the response size exceeds the redirect URL character size limitation.</t>
<t>Any of the OAuth 2.0 related specifications, such as <xref target="RFC9126"></xref> and <xref target="RFC9101"></xref>, and Best Current Practice (BCP) documents, such as <xref target="RFC8252"></xref> and <xref target="RFC9700"></xref>, can be implemented on top of certain parts of this specification.</t>
<t>In summary, OpenID for Verifiable Presentations is a framework that requires profiling
to achieve interoperability. Profiling means defining:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>what optional features are used or mandatory to implement, e.g., response encryption;</li>
<li>which values are permitted for parameters, e.g., Credential Format Identifiers;</li>
<li>optionally, extensions for new features.</li>
</ul>

<t>Below is a diagram of a flow where the End-User presents a Credential to a Verifier interacting with the End-User on the same device that the device the Wallet resides on.</t>
<t>The flow utilizes simple redirects to pass Authorization Request and Response between the Verifier and the Wallet. The Presentations are returned to the Verifier in the fragment part of the redirect URI, when Response Mode is <tt>fragment</tt>.</t>

<t>(1) The Verifier sends an Authorization Request to the Wallet. It contains a Digital Credentials Query Language (DCQL, see <xref target="dcql_query"></xref>) query that describes the requirements of the Credential(s) that the Verifier is requesting to be presented. Such requirements could include what type of Credential(s), in what format(s), which individual Claims within those Credential(s) (Selective Disclosure), etc. The Wallet processes the Authorization Request and determines what Credentials are available matching the Verifier's request. The Wallet also authenticates the End-User and gathers consent to present the requested Credentials.</t>
<t>(2) The Wallet prepares the Presentation(s) of the Credential(s) that the End-User has consented to. It then sends to the Verifier an Authorization Response where the Presentation(s) are contained in the <tt>vp_token</tt> parameter.</t>

<section anchor="cross_device"><name>Cross Device Flow</name>
<t>Below is a diagram of a flow where the End-User presents a Credential to a Verifier interacting with the End-User on a different device as the device the Wallet resides on.</t>
<t>In this flow, the Verifier prepares an Authorization Request and renders it as a QR Code. The End-User then uses the Wallet to scan the QR Code. The Presentations are sent to the Verifier in a direct HTTP POST request to a URL controlled by the Verifier. The flow uses the Response Type <tt>vp_token</tt> in conjunction with the Response Mode <tt>direct_post</tt>, both defined in this specification. In order to keep the size of the QR Code small and be able to sign and optionally encrypt the Request Object, the actual Authorization Request contains just a Request URI according to <xref target="RFC9101"></xref>, which the wallet uses to retrieve the actual Authorization Request data.</t>
<t>Note: The diagram does not illustrate all the optional features of this specification.</t>
<t>Note: The usage of the Request URI as defined in <xref target="RFC9101"></xref> does not depend on any other choices made in the protocol extensibility points, i.e., it can be used in the Same Device Flow, too.</t>

<section anchor="scope"><name>Scope</name>
<t>OpenID for Verifiable Presentations extends existing OAuth 2.0 mechanisms as following:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>A new query language, the Digital Credentials Query Language (DCQL), is defined to enable requesting Presentations in an easier and more flexible way. See <xref target="dcql_query"></xref> for more details.</li>
<li>A new <tt>dcql_query</tt> Authorization Request parameter is defined to request Presentation of Credentials in the JSON-encoded DCQL format. See <xref target="vp_token_request"></xref> for more details.</li>
<li>A new <tt>vp_token</tt> response parameter is defined to return Presentations with or without Holder Binding to the Verifier in either Authorization or Token Response depending on the Response Type. See <xref target="response"></xref> for more details.</li>
<li>New Response Types <tt>vp_token</tt> and <tt>vp_token id_token</tt> are defined to request Credentials to be returned in the Authorization Response (standalone or along with a Self-Issued ID Token <xref target="SIOPv2"></xref>). See <xref target="response"></xref> for more details.</li>
<li>A new OAuth 2.0 Response Mode <tt>direct_post</tt> is defined to support sending the response across devices, or when the size of the response exceeds the redirect URL character size limitation. See <xref target="response_mode_post"></xref> for more details.</li>
<li>The <tt>format</tt> parameter is used throughout the protocol in order to enable customization according to the specific needs of a particular Credential format. Examples in <xref target="format_specific_parameters"></xref> are given for Credential formats as specified in <xref target="VC_DATA"></xref>, <xref target="ISO.18013-5"></xref>, <xref target="I-D.ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc"></xref>, and <xref target="Hyperledger.AnonCreds"></xref>.</li>
<li>The concept of a Client Identifier Prefix to enable deployments of this specification to use different mechanisms to obtain and validate metadata of the Verifier beyond the scope of <xref target="RFC6749"></xref>.</li>
</ul>
<t>Presentation of Credentials using OpenID for Verifiable Presentations can be combined with the End-User authentication using <xref target="SIOPv2"></xref>, and the issuance of OAuth 2.0 Access Tokens.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="vp_token_request"><name>Authorization Request</name>
<t>The Authorization Request follows the definition given in <xref target="RFC6749"></xref> taking into account the recommendations given in <xref target="RFC9700"></xref> where applicable.</t>
<t>The Verifier MAY send an Authorization Request as a Request Object either by value or by reference, as defined in the JWT-Secured Authorization Request (JAR) <xref target="RFC9101"></xref>. Verifiers MUST include the <tt>typ</tt> Header Parameter in Request Objects with the value <tt>oauth-authz-req+jwt</tt>, as defined in <xref target="RFC9101"></xref>. Wallets MUST NOT process Request Objects where the <tt>typ</tt> Header Parameter is not present or does not have the value <tt>oauth-authz-req+jwt</tt>.</t>
<t>The <tt>client_id</tt> claim is required as defined below and would be redundant with a possible <tt>iss</tt> claim in the Request Object which is commonly used in JAR. To not break existing JAR implementations, the <tt>iss</tt> claim MAY be present in the Request Object. However, even if it is present, the Wallet MUST ignore it.</t>
<t>This specification defines a new mechanism for the cases when the Wallet wants to provide to the Verifier details about its technical capabilities to
allow the Verifier to generate a request that matches the technical capabilities of that Wallet.
To enable this, the Authorization Request can contain a <tt>request_uri_method</tt> parameter with the value <tt>post</tt>
that signals to the Wallet that it can make an HTTP POST request to the Verifier's <tt>request_uri</tt>
endpoint with information about its capabilities as defined in <xref target="request_uri_method_post"></xref>. The Wallet MAY continue with JAR
when it receives <tt>request_uri_method</tt> parameter with the value <tt>post</tt> but does not support this feature.</t>
<t>The Verifier articulates requirements of the Credential(s) that are requested using the <tt>dcql_query</tt> parameter. Wallet implementations MUST process the DCQL query and select candidate Credential(s) using the evaluation process described in <xref target="dcql_query_lang_processing_rules"></xref></t>
<t>The Verifier communicates a Client Identifier Prefix that indicate how the Wallet is supposed to interpret the Client Identifier and associated data in the process of Client identification, authentication, and authorization as a prefix in the <tt>client_id</tt> parameter. This enables deployments of this specification to use different mechanisms to obtain and validate Client metadata beyond the scope of <xref target="RFC6749"></xref>. A certain Client Identifier Prefix MAY require the Verifier to sign the Authorization Request as means of authentication and/or pass additional parameters and require the Wallet to process them.</t>
<t>Depending on the Client Identifier Prefix, the Verifier can communicate a JSON object with its metadata using the <tt>client_metadata</tt> parameter which contains name/value pairs.</t>
<t>Additional request parameters, other than those defined in this section, MAY be defined and used, as described in <xref target="RFC6749"></xref>.
The Wallet MUST ignore any unrecognized parameters, other than the <tt>transaction_data</tt> parameter.
One exception to this rule is <tt>transaction_data</tt> parameter, and the Wallets that do not support this parameter MUST reject requests that contain it.</t>

<section anchor="new_parameters"><name>New Parameters</name>
<t>This specification defines the following new request parameters:</t>

<dl spacing="compact">
<dt><tt>dcql_query</tt>:</dt>
<dd>A JSON object containing a DCQL query as defined in <xref target="dcql_query"></xref>.</dd>
</dl>
<t>Either a <tt>dcql_query</tt> or a <tt>scope</tt> parameter representing a DCQL Query MUST be present in the Authorization Request, but not both.</t>
<t>In the context of an authorization request according to <xref target="RFC6749"></xref>, parameters containing objects are transferred as JSON-serialized strings (using the application/x-www-form-urlencoded format as usual for request parameters).</t>

<dl>
<dt><tt>client_metadata</tt>:</dt>
<dd><t>OPTIONAL. A JSON object containing the Verifier metadata values. It MUST be UTF-8 encoded. The following metadata parameters MAY be used:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li><tt>jwks</tt>: OPTIONAL. A JSON Web Key Set, as defined in <xref target="RFC7591"></xref>, that contains one or more public keys, such as those used by the Wallet as an input to a key agreement that may be used for encryption of the Authorization Response (see <xref target="response_encryption"></xref>), or where the Wallet will require the public key of the Verifier to generate a Verifiable Presentation. This allows the Verifier to pass ephemeral keys specific to this Authorization Request. Public keys included in this parameter MUST NOT be used to verify the signature of signed Authorization Requests. Each JWK in the set MUST have a <tt>kid</tt> (Key ID) parameter that uniquely identifies the key within the context of the request.</li>
<li><tt>authorization_encrypted_response_enc</tt>: OPTIONAL. As defined in <xref target="JARM"></xref>. The JWE <xref target="RFC7516"></xref> <tt>enc</tt> algorithm is used to convey the requested content encryption algorithm for encrypting the authorization response. When a <tt>response_mode</tt> requiring encryption of the Authorization Response (such as <tt>dc_api.jwt</tt> or <tt>direct_post.jwt</tt>) is specified this MUST be present for anything other than the default value of <tt>A128GCM</tt>. Otherwise this SHOULD be absent. Note that because the response can be encrypted (see <xref target="response_encryption"></xref>) but not signed, most of the general mechanisms of JARM do not apply. However, the  <tt>authorization_encrypted_response_enc</tt> metadata parameter from JARM is reused to avoid redefining it.</li>
<li><tt>vp_formats</tt>: REQUIRED when not available to the Wallet via another mechanism. As defined in <xref target="client_metadata_parameters"></xref>.</li>
</ul>
<t>Authoritative data the Wallet is able to obtain about the Client from other sources, for example those from an OpenID Federation Entity Statement, take precedence over the values passed in <tt>client_metadata</tt>.</t>
<t>Other metadata parameters MUST be ignored unless a profile of this specification explicitly defines them as usable in the <tt>client_metadata</tt> parameter.</t>
</dd>
<dt><tt>request_uri_method</tt>:</dt>
<dd><t>OPTIONAL. A string determining the HTTP method to be used when the <tt>request_uri</tt> parameter is included in the same request. Two case-sensitive valid values are defined in this specification: <tt>get</tt> and <tt>post</tt>. If <tt>request_uri_method</tt> value is <tt>get</tt>, the Wallet MUST send the request to retrieve the Request Object using the HTTP GET method, i.e., as defined in <xref target="RFC9101"></xref>. If <tt>request_uri_method</tt> value is <tt>post</tt>, a supporting Wallet MUST send the request using the HTTP POST method as detailed in <xref target="request_uri_method_post"></xref>. If the <tt>request_uri_method</tt> parameter is not present, the Wallet MUST process the <tt>request_uri</tt> parameter as defined in <xref target="RFC9101"></xref>. Wallets not supporting the <tt>post</tt> method will send a GET request to the Request URI (default behavior as defined in <xref target="RFC9101"></xref>). <tt>request_uri_method</tt> parameter MUST NOT be present if a <tt>request_uri</tt> parameter is not present.</t>
</dd>
</dl>
<t>If the Verifier set the <tt>request_uri_method</tt> parameter value to <tt>post</tt> and there is no other means to convey its capabilities to the Wallet, it SHOULD add the <tt>client_metadata</tt> parameter to the Authorization Request.
This enables the Wallet to assess the Verifier's capabilities, allowing it to transmit only the relevant capabilities through the <tt>wallet_metadata</tt> parameter in the Request URI POST request.</t>

<dl>
<dt><tt>transaction_data</tt>:</dt>
<dd><t>OPTIONAL. Array of strings, where each string is a base64url encoded JSON object that contains a typed parameter set with details about the transaction that the Verifier is requesting the End-User to authorize. See <xref target="transaction_data"></xref> for details. The Wallet MUST return an error if a request contains even one unrecognized transaction data type or transaction data not conforming to the respective type definition. In addition to the parameters determined by the type of transaction data, each <tt>transaction_data</tt> object consists of the following parameters defined by this specification:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li><tt>type</tt>: REQUIRED. String that identifies the type of transaction data. This value determines parameters that can be included in the <tt>transaction_data</tt> object. The specific values are out of scope of this specification. It is RECOMMENDED to use collision-resistant names for <tt>type</tt> values.</li>
<li><tt>credential_ids</tt>: REQUIRED. Array of strings each referencing a Credential requested by the Verifier that can be used to authorize this transaction. The string matches the <tt>id</tt> field in the DCQL Credential Query. If there is more than one element in the array, the Wallet MUST use only one of the referenced Credentials for transaction authorization.</li>
</ul></dd>
</dl>
<t>Each document specifying details of a transaction data type defines what Credential(s) can be used to authorize those transactions. Those Credential(s) can be issued specifically for the transaction authorization use case or re-use existing Credential(s) used for user identification. A mechanism for Credential Issuers to express that a particular Credential can be used for authorization of transaction data is out of scope for this specification.</t>
<t>The following is a non-normative example of a transaction data content, after base64url decoding one of the strings in the <tt>transaction_data</tt> parameter:</t>

<artwork>{
  &quot;type&quot;: &quot;example_type&quot;,
  &quot;credential_ids&quot;: [ &quot;id_card_credential&quot; ],
  // other transaction data type specific parameters
}
</artwork>

<dl>
<dt><tt>verifier_attestations</tt>:</dt>
<dd><t>OPTIONAL. An array of attestations about the Verifier relevant to the Credential Request. These attestations MAY include Verifier metadata, policies, trust status, or authorizations. Attestations are intended to support authorization decisions, inform Wallet policy enforcement, or enrich the End-User consent dialog. Each object has the following structure:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li><tt>format</tt>: REQUIRED. A string that identifies the format of the attestation and how it is encoded. Ecosystems SHOULD use collision-resistant identifiers. Further processing of the attestation is determined by the type of the attestation, which is specified in a format-specific way.</li>
<li><tt>data</tt>: REQUIRED. An object or string containing an attestation (e.g. a JWT). The payload structure is defined on a per format level. The Wallet MUST validate this signature and ensure binding.</li>
<li><tt>credential_ids</tt>: OPTIONAL. An array of strings each referencing a Credential requested by the Verifier for which the attestation is relevant. Each string matches the <tt>id</tt> field in a DCQL Credential Query. If omitted, the attestation is relevant to all requested credentials.</li>
</ul></dd>
</dl>
<t>See <xref target="verifier-attestations"></xref> for more details.</t>
<t>The following is a non-normative example of an attested object:</t>

<section anchor="existing_parameters"><name>Existing Parameters</name>
<t>The following additional considerations are given for pre-existing Authorization Request parameters:</t>

<dl spacing="compact">
<dt><tt>nonce</tt>:</dt>
<dd>REQUIRED. A case-sensitive String representing value to securely bind Verifiable Presentation(s) provided by the Wallet to the particular transaction. The Verifier MUST create a fresh, cryptographically random number with sufficient entropy for every Authorization Request, store it with its current session, and pass it in the <tt>nonce</tt> Authorization Request Parameter to the Wallet. See <xref target="preventing-replay"></xref> for details. Values MUST only contain ASCII URL safe characters (uppercase and lowercase letters, decimal digits, hyphen, period, underscore, and tilde). If OpenID Connect is used, refer to its definition in <xref target="OpenID.Core"></xref>.</dd>
<dt><tt>scope</tt>:</dt>
<dd>OPTIONAL. Defined in <xref target="RFC6749"></xref>. The Wallet MAY allow Verifiers to request Presentations by utilizing a pre-defined scope value. See <xref target="request_scope"></xref> for more details.</dd>
<dt><tt>response_mode</tt>:</dt>
<dd>REQUIRED. Defined in <xref target="OAuth.Responses"></xref>. This parameter can be used (through the new Response Mode <tt>direct_post</tt>) to ask the Wallet to send the response to the Verifier via an HTTPS connection (see <xref target="response_mode_post"></xref> for more details). It can also be used to request that the resulting response be encrypted (see <xref target="response_encryption"></xref> for more details).</dd>
<dt><tt>client_id</tt>:</dt>
<dd>REQUIRED for non-DC API implementations. Defined in <xref target="RFC6749"></xref>. This specification defines additional requirements to enable the use of Client Identifier Prefixes as described in <xref target="client_metadata_management"></xref>.</dd>
<dt><tt>state</tt>:</dt>
<dd>REQUIRED under the conditions defined in <xref target="nkb-credentials"></xref>. Otherwise, <tt>state</tt> is OPTIONAL. <tt>state</tt> values MUST only contain ASCII URL safe characters (uppercase and lowercase letters, decimal digits, hyphen, period, underscore, and tilde).</dd>
</dl>
</section>

<section anchor="nkb-credentials"><name>Requesting Presentations without Holder Binding Proofs</name>
<t>The primary use case of this specification is to request and present Verifiable
Presentations, i.e., Presentations that contain a cryptographic Holder Binding proof.</t>
<t>However, there are use cases where the Verifier wants to request presentation of
Credentials without a proof of cryptographic Holder Binding. Examples for such use cases include
low-security Credentials that do not support Holder Binding (e.g., a cinema
ticket), Credentials that are bound to a biometric trait, or Credentials that
are bound to claims (e.g., a diploma). In some cases, Credentials may support
Holder Binding, but the Verifier may not require it for the Presentation.</t>
<t>A Verifier that requests and accepts a Presentation of a Credential without a
proof of Holder Binding accepts that the presented Credential may have been
replayed. <xref target="preventing-replay"></xref> contains additional considerations for this case.</t>
<t>To request a Credential without proof of Holder Binding, the Verifier uses the <tt>require_cryptographic_holder_binding</tt> parameter in the DCQL request as defined in <xref target="dcql_query"></xref> and
<xref target="format_specific_parameters"></xref>.</t>
<t>In this protocol, the <tt>nonce</tt> parameter serves to securely link the request and
response and as a replay protection in the Holder Binding proof. Without the key
binding proof, <tt>nonce</tt> is not returned in the response. To maintain the binding
between request and response, the Verifier MUST</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>include a <tt>state</tt> parameter as defined in Section 4.1.1 of <xref target="RFC6749"></xref> in the
Authorization Request,</li>
<li>ensure that the value is a cryptographically strong pseudo-random number with
at least 128 bits of entropy,</li>
<li>ensure that the value is chosen fresh for each Authorization Request,</li>
<li>store it in the Verifier's session state, and</li>
<li>check that the same <tt>state</tt> value is returned in the Authorization Response,</li>
</ul>
<t>if at least one Presentation without Holder Binding is requested and unless the
Digital Credentials API is used. The Digital Credentials API uses internal
mechanisms to maintain the binding.</t>
<t>When using Response Mode <tt>direct_post</tt>, also see
<xref target="security_considerations_direct_post"></xref>.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="examples"><name>Examples</name>
<t>The Verifier MAY send an Authorization Request using either of these 3 options:</t>

<ol spacing="compact">
<li>Passing as URL with encoded parameters</li>
<li>Passing a request object as value</li>
<li>Passing a request object by reference</li>
</ol>
<t>The second and third options are defined in the JWT-Secured Authorization Request (JAR) <xref target="RFC9101"></xref>.</t>

<section anchor="request_scope"><name>Using <tt>scope</tt> Parameter to Request Presentations</name>
<t>Wallets MAY support requesting Presentations using OAuth 2.0 scope values.</t>
<t>Such a <tt>scope</tt> parameter value MUST be an alias for a well-defined DCQL query. Since multiple <tt>scope</tt> values can be used at the same time, the identifiers for credentials (see <xref target="credential_query"></xref>) and claims (see <xref target="claims_query"></xref>) within the DCQL queries associated with <tt>scope</tt> values MUST be unique. This ensures that there are no collisions between the identifiers used in the DCQL queries and that the Verifier can unambiguously identify the requested Credentials in the response.</t>
<t>The specific scope values, and the mapping between a certain scope value and the respective
DCQL query is out of scope of this specification.</t>
<t>Possible options include normative text in a separate specification defining scope values along with a description of their
semantics or machine-readable definitions in the Wallet's server metadata, mapping a scope value to an equivalent
DCQL request.</t>
<t>It is RECOMMENDED to use collision-resistant scopes values.</t>
<t>The following is a non-normative example of an Authorization Request using the example scope value <tt>com.example.IDCardCredential_presentation</tt>:</t>

<section anchor="response_type_vp_token"><name>Response Type <tt>vp_token</tt></name>
<t>This specification defines the Response Type <tt>vp_token</tt>.</t>

<dl spacing="compact">
<dt><tt>vp_token</tt>:</dt>
<dd>When supplied as the <tt>response_type</tt> parameter in an Authorization Request, a successful response MUST include the <tt>vp_token</tt> parameter. The Wallet SHOULD NOT return an OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code, Access Token, or Access Token Type in a successful response to the grant request. The default Response Mode for this Response Type is <tt>fragment</tt>, i.e., the Authorization Response parameters are encoded in the fragment added to the <tt>redirect_uri</tt> when redirecting back to the Verifier. The Response Type <tt>vp_token</tt> can be used with other Response Modes as defined in <xref target="OAuth.Responses"></xref>. Both successful and error responses SHOULD be returned using the supplied Response Mode, or if none is supplied, using the default Response Mode.</dd>

</section>

<section anchor="passing-authorization-request-across-devices"><name>Passing Authorization Request Across Devices</name>
<t>There are use-cases when the Authorization Request is being displayed on a device different from a device on which the requested Credential is stored. In those cases, an Authorization Request can be passed across devices by being rendered as a QR Code.</t>
<t>The usage of the Response Mode <tt>direct_post</tt> (see <xref target="response_mode_post"></xref>) in conjunction with <tt>request_uri</tt> is RECOMMENDED, since Authorization Request size might be large and might not fit in a QR code.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="aud-of-a-request-object"><name><tt>aud</tt> of a Request Object</name>
<t>When the Verifier is sending a Request Object as defined in <xref target="RFC9101"></xref>, the <tt>aud</tt> Claim value depends on whether the recipient of the request can be identified by the Verifier or not:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>the <tt>aud</tt> Claim MUST equal to the <tt>issuer</tt> Claim value, when Dynamic Discovery is performed.</li>
<li>the <tt>aud</tt> Claim MUST be &quot;<eref target="https://self-issued.me/v2&quot;">https://self-issued.me/v2"</eref>, when Static Discovery metadata is used.</li>
</ul>
<t>Note: &quot;<eref target="https://self-issued.me/v2&quot;">https://self-issued.me/v2"</eref> is a symbolic string and can be used as an <tt>aud</tt> Claim value even when this specification is used standalone, without SIOPv2.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="client_metadata_management"><name>Client Identifier Prefix and Verifier Metadata Management</name>
<t>This specification defines the concept of a Client Identifier Prefix that indicates how the Wallet is supposed to interpret the Client Identifier and associated data in the process of Client identification, authentication, and authorization. The Client Identifier Prefix enables deployments of this specification to use different mechanisms to obtain and validate metadata of the Verifier beyond the scope of <xref target="RFC6749"></xref>. The term Client Identifier Prefix is used since the Verifier is acting as an OAuth 2.0 Client.</t>
<t>The Client Identifier Prefix is a string that MAY be communicated by the Verifier in a prefix within the <tt>client_id</tt> parameter in the Authorization Request. A fallback to pre-registered Clients as in <xref target="RFC6749"></xref> remains in place as a default mechanism in case no Client Identifier Prefix was provided. A certain Client Identifier Prefix may require the Verifier to sign the Authorization Request as means of authentication and/or pass additional parameters and require the Wallet to process them.</t>

<section anchor="syntax"><name>Syntax</name>
<t>In the <tt>client_id</tt> Authorization Request parameter and other places where the Client Identifier is used, the Client Identifier Prefixes are prefixed to the usual Client Identifier, separated by a <tt>:</tt> (colon) character:</t>

<artwork>&lt;client_id_prefix&gt;:&lt;orig_client_id&gt;
</artwork>
<t>Here, <tt>&lt;client_id_prefix&gt;</tt> is the Client Identifier Prefix and <tt>&lt;orig_client_id&gt;</tt> is an identifier for the Client within the namespace of that prefix. See <xref target="client_identifier_prefixes"></xref> for Client Identifier Prefixes defined by this specification.</t>
<t>Wallets MUST use the presence of a <tt>:</tt> (colon) character and the content preceding it to determine whether a Client Identifier Prefix is used. If a <tt>:</tt> character is present and the content preceding it is a recognized and supported Client Identifier Prefix value, the Wallet MUST interpret the Client Identifier according to the given Client Identifier Prefix. The Client Identifier Prefix is defined as the string before the (first) <tt>:</tt> character. Note that implementations should not assume that the presence of a <tt>:</tt> character implies that the entire value can be processed as a valid URI. Instead, the specific processing rules defined for the specified Client Identifier Prefix (see <xref target="client_identifier_prefixes"></xref>) should be used to parse the <tt>client_id</tt> value.</t>
<t>For example, an Authorization Request might contain <tt>client_id=verifier_attestation:example-client</tt> to indicate that the <tt>verifier_attestation</tt> Client Identifier Prefix is to be used and that within this prefix, the Verifier can be identified by the string <tt>example-client</tt>. The presentation would contain the full <tt>verifier_attestation:example-client</tt> string as the audience (intended receiver) and the same full string would be used as the Client Identifier anywhere in the OAuth flow.</t>
<t>Note that the Verifier needs to determine which Client Identifier Prefixes the Wallet supports prior to sending the Authorization Request in order to choose a supported prefix.</t>
<t>Depending on the Client Identifier Prefix, the Verifier can communicate a JSON object with its metadata using the <tt>client_metadata</tt> parameter which contains name/value pairs.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="fallback"><name>Fallback</name>
<t>If a <tt>:</tt> character is not present in the Client Identifier, the Wallet MUST treat the Client Identifier as referencing a pre-registered client. This is equivalent to the <xref target="RFC6749"></xref> default behavior, i.e., the Client Identifier needs to be known to the Wallet in advance of the Authorization Request. The Verifier metadata is obtained using <xref target="RFC7591"></xref> or through out-of-band mechanisms.</t>
<t>For example, if an Authorization Request contains <tt>client_id=example-client</tt>, the Wallet would interpret the Client Identifier as referring to a pre-registered client.</t>
<t>If a <tt>:</tt> character is present in the Client Identifier but the value preceding it is not a recognized and supported Client Identifier Prefix value, the Wallet can treat the Client Identifier as referring to a pre-registered client or it may refuse the request.</t>
<t>From this definition, it follows that pre-registered clients MUST NOT contain a <tt>:</tt> character preceded immediately by a supported Client Identifier Prefix value in the first part of their Client Identifier.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="client_identifier_prefixes"><name>Defined Client Identifier Prefixes</name>
<t>This specification defines the following Client Identifier Prefixes, followed by the examples where applicable:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li><tt>redirect_uri</tt>: This prefix value indicates that the original Client Identifier part (without the prefix <tt>redirect_uri:</tt>) is the Verifier's Redirect URI (or Response URI when Response Mode <tt>direct_post</tt> is used). The Verifier MAY omit the <tt>redirect_uri</tt> Authorization Request parameter (or <tt>response_uri</tt> when Response Mode <tt>direct_post</tt> is used). All Verifier metadata parameters MUST be passed using the <tt>client_metadata</tt> parameter defined in <xref target="new_parameters"></xref>. An example Client Identifier value is <tt>redirect_uri:https://client.example.org/cb</tt>. Requests using the <tt>redirect_uri</tt> Client Identifier Prefix cannot be signed because there is no method for the Wallet to obtain a trusted key for verification. Therefore, implementations requiring signed requests cannot use the <tt>redirect_uri</tt> Client ID Prefix.</li>
</ul>
<t>The following is a non-normative example of an unsigned request with the <tt>redirect_uri</tt> Client Identifier Prefix:</t>

<ul>
<li><t><tt>openid_federation</tt>: This prefix value indicates that the original Client Identifier (the part without the prefix <tt>openid_federation:</tt>) is an Entity Identifier defined in OpenID Federation <xref target="OpenID.Federation"></xref>. Processing rules given in <xref target="OpenID.Federation"></xref> MUST be followed. The Authorization Request MAY also contain a <tt>trust_chain</tt> parameter. The final Verifier metadata is obtained from the Trust Chain after applying the policies, according to <xref target="OpenID.Federation"></xref>. The <tt>client_metadata</tt> parameter, if present in the Authorization Request, MUST be ignored when this Client Identifier Prefix is used.

<li><t><tt>decentralized_identifier</tt>: This prefix value indicates that the original Client Identifier (the part without the prefix <tt>decentralized_identifier:</tt>) is a Decentralized Identifier as defined in <xref target="DID-Core"></xref>. The request MUST be signed with a private key associated with the DID. A public key to verify the signature MUST be obtained from the <tt>verificationMethod</tt> property of a DID Document. Since DID Document may include multiple public keys, a particular public key used to sign the request in question MUST be identified by the <tt>kid</tt> in the JOSE Header. To obtain the DID Document, the Wallet MUST use DID Resolution defined by the DID method used by the Verifier. All Verifier metadata other than the public key MUST be obtained from the <tt>client_metadata</tt> parameter as defined in <xref target="new_parameters"></xref>. Example Client Identifier: <tt>decentralized_identifier:did:example:123</tt>.</t>

<ul>
<li><t><tt>verifier_attestation</tt>: This Client Identifier Prefix allows the Verifier to authenticate using a JWT that is bound to a certain public key as defined in <xref target="verifier_attestation_jwt"></xref>. When the Client Identifier Prefix is <tt>verifier_attestation</tt>, the original Client Identifier (the part without the <tt>verifier_attestation:</tt> prefix) MUST equal the <tt>sub</tt> claim value in the Verifier attestation JWT. The request MUST be signed with the private key corresponding to the public key in the <tt>cnf</tt> claim in the Verifier attestation JWT. This serves as proof of possession of this key. The Verifier attestation JWT MUST be added to the <tt>jwt</tt> JOSE Header of the request object (see <xref target="verifier_attestation_jwt"></xref>). The Wallet MUST validate the signature on the Verifier attestation JWT. The <tt>iss</tt> claim value of the Verifier Attestation JWT MUST identify a party the Wallet trusts for issuing Verifier Attestation JWTs. If the Wallet cannot establish trust, it MUST refuse the request. If the issuer of the Verifier Attestation JWT adds a <tt>redirect_uris</tt> claim to the attestation, the Wallet MUST ensure the <tt>redirect_uri</tt> request parameter value exactly matches one of the <tt>redirect_uris</tt> claim entries. All Verifier metadata other than the public key MUST be obtained from the <tt>client_metadata</tt> parameter. Example Client Identifier: <tt>verifier_attestation:verifier.example</tt>.</t>
</li>
<li><t><tt>x509_san_dns</tt>: When the Client Identifier Prefix is <tt>x509_san_dns</tt>, the original Client Identifier (the part after the <tt>x509_san_dns:</tt> prefix) MUST be a DNS name and match a <tt>dNSName</tt> Subject Alternative Name (SAN) <xref target="RFC5280"></xref> entry in the leaf certificate passed with the request. The request MUST be signed with the private key corresponding to the public key in the leaf X.509 certificate of the certificate chain added to the request in the <tt>x5c</tt> JOSE header <xref target="RFC7515"></xref> of the signed request object. The Wallet MUST validate the signature and the trust chain of the X.509 certificate. All Verifier metadata other than the public key MUST be obtained from the <tt>client_metadata</tt> parameter. The following requirement applies unless the interaction is using the DC API as defined in <xref target="dc_api"></xref>: If the Wallet can establish trust in the Client Identifier authenticated through the certificate, e.g. because the Client Identifier is contained in a list of trusted Client Identifiers, it may allow the client to freely choose the <tt>redirect_uri</tt> value. If not, the FQDN of the <tt>redirect_uri</tt> value MUST match the Client Identifier without the prefix <tt>x509_san_dns:</tt>. Example Client Identifier: <tt>x509_san_dns:client.example.org</tt>.</t>
</li>
<li><t><tt>x509_hash</tt>: When the Client Identifier Prefix is <tt>x509_hash</tt>, the original Client Identifier (the part without the <tt>x509_hash:</tt> prefix) MUST be a hash and match the hash of the leaf certificate passed with the request. The request MUST be signed with the private key corresponding to the public key in the leaf X.509 certificate of the certificate chain added to the request in the <tt>x5c</tt> JOSE header parameter <xref target="RFC7515"></xref> of the signed request object. The value of <tt>x509_hash</tt> is the base64url encoded value of the SHA-256 hash of the DER-encoded X.509 certificate. The Wallet MUST validate the signature and the trust chain of the X.509 leaf certificate. All verifier metadata other than the public key MUST be obtained from the <tt>client_metadata</tt> parameter. Example Client Identifier: <tt>x509_hash:Uvo3HtuIxuhC92rShpgqcT3YXwrqRxWEviRiA0OZszk</tt></t>
</li>
<li><t><tt>origin</tt>: This reserved Client Identifier Prefix is defined in <xref target="dc_api_request"></xref>. The Wallet MUST NOT accept this Client Identifier Prefix in requests. In OpenID4VP over the Digital Credentials API, the audience of the Credential Presentation is always the origin value prefixed by <tt>origin:</tt>, for example <tt>origin:https://verifier.example.com/</tt>.</t>
</li>
</ul>
<t>To use the Client Identifier Prefixes <tt>openid_federation</tt>, <tt>decentralized_identifier</tt>, <tt>verifier_attestation</tt>, <tt>x509_san_dns</tt> and <tt>x509_hash</tt>, Verifiers MUST be capable of securely storing private key material. This might require changes to the technical design of native apps as such apps are typically public clients.</t>
<t>Other specifications can define further Client Identifier Prefixes. It is RECOMMENDED to use collision-resistant names for such values.</t>
</section>
</section>

<section anchor="request_uri_method_post"><name>Request URI Method <tt>post</tt></name>
<t>This request is handled by the Request URI endpoint of the Verifier.</t>
<t>The request MUST use the HTTP POST method with the <tt>https</tt> scheme, and the content type <tt>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</tt> and the accept header set to <tt>application/oauth-authz-req+jwt</tt>. The names and values in the body MUST be encoded using UTF-8.</t>
<t>The following parameters are defined to be included in the request to the Request URI Endpoint:</t>

<dl spacing="compact">
<dt><tt>wallet_metadata</tt>:</dt>
<dd>OPTIONAL. A String containing a JSON object containing metadata parameters as defined in <xref target="as_metadata_parameters"></xref>.</dd>
<dt><tt>wallet_nonce</tt>:</dt>
<dd>OPTIONAL. A String value used to mitigate replay attacks of the Authorization Request. When received, the Verifier MUST use it as the <tt>wallet_nonce</tt> value in the signed authorization request object. Value can be a base64url-encoded, fresh, cryptographically random number with sufficient entropy.<br />
</dd>
</dl>
<t>If the Wallet requires the Verifier to encrypt the Request Object, it SHOULD use the <tt>jwks</tt> or <tt>jwks_uri</tt> parameter within the <tt>wallet_metadata</tt> parameter to pass the public key for the input to the key agreement. Other mechanisms to pass the encryption key can be used as well. If the Wallet requires an encrypted Authorization Response, it SHOULD specify supported encryption algorithms using the <tt>authorization_encryption_alg_values_supported</tt> and <tt>authorization_encryption_enc_values_supported</tt> parameters.</t>
<t>Additionally, if the Client Identifier Prefix permits signed Request Objects, the Wallet SHOULD list supported cryptographic algorithms for securing the Request Object through the <tt>request_object_signing_alg_values_supported</tt> parameter. Conversely, the Wallet MUST NOT include this parameter if the Client Identifier Prefix precludes signed Request Objects.</t>
<t>Additional  parameters MAY be defined and used in the request to the Request URI Endpoint.
The Verifier MUST ignore any unrecognized parameters.</t>
<t>The following is a non-normative example of a request:</t>

</artwork>

<section anchor="request-uri-response"><name>Request URI Response</name>
<t>The Request URI response MUST be an HTTP response with the content type &quot;application/oauth-authz-req+jwt&quot; and the body being a signed, optionally encrypted, request object as defined in <xref target="RFC9101"></xref>. The request object MUST fulfill the requirements as defined in <xref target="vp_token_request"></xref>.</t>
<t>The following is a non-normative example of a payload for a request object:</t>

<sourcecode type="json">{
  &quot;client_id&quot;: &quot;x509_san_dns:client.example.org&quot;,
  &quot;response_uri&quot;: &quot;https://client.example.org/post&quot;,

  &quot;state&quot; : &quot;eyJhb...6-sVA&quot;
}
</sourcecode>
<t>The Wallet MUST process the request as defined in <xref target="RFC9101"></xref>. Additionally, if the Wallet passed a <tt>wallet_nonce</tt> in the POST request, the Wallet MUST validate whether the request object contains the respective nonce value in a <tt>wallet_nonce</tt> claim. If it does not, the Wallet MUST terminate request processing.</t>
<t>The Wallet MUST extract the set of Authorization Request parameters from the Request Object. The Wallet MUST only use the parameters in this Request Object, even if the same parameter was provided in an Authorization Request query parameter. The Client Identifier value in the <tt>client_id</tt> Authorization Request parameter and the Request Object <tt>client_id</tt> claim value MUST be identical, including the Client Identifier Prefix. If any of these conditions are not met, the Wallet MUST terminate request processing.</t>
<t>The Wallet then validates the request as specified in OAuth 2.0 <xref target="RFC6749"></xref>.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="request-uri-error-response"><name>Request URI Error Response</name>
<t>If the Verifier responds with any HTTP error response, the Wallet MUST terminate the process.</t>
</section>
</section>

<section anchor="verifier-attestations"><name>Verifier Attestations</name>
<t>Verifier Attestations allow the Verifier to provide additional context or metadata as part of the Authorization Request attested by a trusted third party. These inputs can support a variety of use cases, such as helping the Wallet apply policy decisions, validating eligibility, or presenting more meaningful information to the End-User during consent.</t>
<t>Each Verifier Attestation is an object containing a type identifier, associated data and optionally references to credential ids. The format and semantics of these attestations are defined by ecosystems or profiles.</t>
<t>For example, a Verifier might include:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>A <strong>registration certificate</strong> issued by a trusted authority, to prove that the verifier has publicly registered its intend to request certain credentials.</li>
<li>A <strong>policy statement</strong>, such as a signed document describing acceptable use, retention periods, or access rights.</li>
<li>The <strong>confirmation of a role</strong> of the verifier in a certain domain, e.g. the verifier might be a certified payment service provider under the EU's Payment Service Directive 2.</li>
</ul>
<t>Verifier Attestations are optional. Wallets MAY use them to make authorization decisions or to enhance the user experience, but they SHOULD ignore any unrecognized or unsupported Verifier Attestation types.</t>

<section anchor="proof-of-possession"><name>Proof of Possession</name>
<t>This specification supports two models for proof of possession:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li><strong>claim-bound attestations</strong>: The attestation is not signed by the Relying Party, but bound to it. The exact binding mechanism is defined by the type of the definition. For example for JWTs, the <tt>sub</tt> claim is including the distinguished name of the Certificate that was used to sign the request. The binding may also include the client_id parameter.</li>
<li><strong>key-bound attestations</strong>: The attestation's proof of possession is signed by the Relying Party with a key contained or related to the attestation . To bind the signature to the presentation request, the respective signature object should include the <tt>nonce</tt> and <tt>client_id</tt> request parameters. The attestation and the proof of possession have to be passed in the attachment.</li>
</ul>
<t>The Wallet MUST validate such proofs if defined by the profile and ignore or reject attachments that fail validation.</t>
</section>
</section>
</section>

<section anchor="dcql_query"><name>Digital Credentials Query Language (DCQL)</name>
<t>The Digital Credentials Query Language (DCQL, pronounced [ˈdakl̩]) is a
JSON-encoded query language that allows the Verifier to request
Presentations that match the query. The Verifier MAY encode constraints on the
combinations of credentials and claims that are requested. The Wallet evaluates
the query against the Credentials it holds and returns
Presentations matching the query.</t>
<t>A valid DCQL query is defined as a JSON-encoded object with the following
top-level properties:</t>

<dl spacing="compact">
<dt><tt>credentials</tt>:</dt>
<dd>REQUIRED. A non-empty array of Credential Queries as defined in <xref target="credential_query"></xref>
that specify the requested Credentials.</dd>
<dt><tt>credential_sets</tt>:</dt>
<dd>OPTIONAL. A non-empty array of credential set queries as defined in <xref target="credential_set_query"></xref>
that specifies additional constraints on which of the requested Credentials to return.</dd>
</dl>
<t>Note: Future extensions may define additional properties both on the top level
and in the rest of the DCQL data structure. Implementations MUST ignore any
unknown properties.</t>

<section anchor="credential_query"><name>Credential Query</name>
<t>A Credential Query is an object representing a request for a presentation of one or more matching
Credentials.</t>
<t>Each entry in <tt>credentials</tt> MUST be an object with the following properties:</t>

<dl spacing="compact">
<dt><tt>id</tt>:</dt>
<dd>REQUIRED. A string identifying the Credential in the response and, if provided,
the constraints in <tt>credential_sets</tt>. The value MUST be a non-empty string
consisting of alphanumeric, underscore (<tt>_</tt>) or hyphen (<tt>-</tt>) characters.
Within the Authorization Request, the same <tt>id</tt> MUST NOT
be present more than once.</dd>
<dt><tt>format</tt>:</dt>
<dd>REQUIRED. A string that specifies the format of the requested Credential. Valid Credential Format Identifier values are defined in
<xref target="format_specific_parameters"></xref>.</dd>
<dt><tt>multiple</tt>:</dt>
<dd>OPTIONAL. A boolean which indicates whether multiple Credentials can be returned for this Credential Query. If omitted, the default value is <tt>false</tt>.</dd>
<dt><tt>meta</tt>:</dt>
<dd>OPTIONAL. An object defining additional properties requested by the Verifier that
apply to the metadata and validity data of the Credential. The properties of
this object are defined per Credential Format. Examples of those are in <xref target="sd_jwt_vc_meta_parameter"></xref> and <xref target="mdocs_meta_parameter"></xref>. If omitted,
no specific constraints are placed on the metadata or validity of the requested
Credential.</dd>

<dd>OPTIONAL. A non-empty array of objects as defined in <xref target="dcql_trusted_authorities"></xref> that
specifies expected authorities or trust frameworks that certify Issuers, that the
Verifier will accept. Every Credential returned by the Wallet SHOULD match at least
one of the conditions present in the corresponding <tt>trusted_authorities</tt> array if present.</dd>
</dl>
<t>Note that Relying Parties must verify that the issuer of a received presentation is
trusted on their own and this feature mainly aims to help data minimization by not
revealing information that would likely be rejected.</t>

<dl spacing="compact">
<dt><tt>require_cryptographic_holder_binding</tt>:</dt>
<dd>OPTIONAL. A boolean which indicates whether the Verifier requires a Cryptographic Holder Binding
proof. The default value is <tt>true</tt>, i.e., a Verifiable Presentation with Cryptographic Holder Binding
is required. If set to <tt>false</tt>, the Verifier accepts a Credential without Cryptographic Holder Binding
proof.</dd>
<dt><tt>claims</tt>:</dt>
<dd>OPTIONAL. A non-empty array of objects as defined in <xref target="claims_query"></xref> that specifies
claims in the requested Credential. Verifiers MUST NOT point to the same claim more than

<dd>OPTIONAL. A non-empty array containing arrays of identifiers for
elements in <tt>claims</tt> that specifies which combinations of <tt>claims</tt> for the Credential are requested.
The rules for selecting claims to send are defined in <xref target="selecting_claims"></xref>.</dd>
</dl>
<t>Multiple Credential Queries in a request MAY request a presentation of the same Credential.</t>

<section anchor="dcql_trusted_authorities"><name>Trusted Authorities Query</name>
<t>A Trusted Authorities Query is an object representing information that helps to identify an authority
or the trust framework that certifies Issuers. A Credential is identified as a match
to a Trusted Authorities Query if it matches with one of the provided values in one of the provided
types. How exactly the matching works is defined for the different types below</t>
<t>Note that direct Issuer matching can also work using claim value matching if supported (e.g., value matching
the <tt>iss</tt> claim in an SD-JWT) if the mechanisms for <tt>trusted_authorities</tt> are not applicable but might
be less likely to work due to the constraints on value matching (see #selecting_claims for more details).</t>
<t>Each entry in <tt>trusted_authorities</tt> MUST be an object with the following properties:</t>

<dl spacing="compact">
<dt><tt>type</tt>:</dt>
<dd>REQUIRED. A string uniquely identifying the type of information about the issuer trust framework.
Types defined by this specification are listed below.</dd>
<dt><tt>values</tt>:</dt>
<dd>REQUIRED. An array of strings, where each string (value) contains information specific to the
used Trusted Authorities Query type that allows to identify an issuer, trust framework, or a federation that an
issuer belongs to.</dd>
</dl>
<t>Below are descriptions for the different Type Identifiers (string), the description on how to interpret
and perform the matching logic for each provided value.</t>

</dl>
</section>

<section anchor="dcql_query_lang_processing_rules"><name>Selecting Claims and Credentials</name>
<t>The following section describes the logic that applies for selecting claims
and for selecting credentials.</t>
<t>For formats supporting selective disclosure, these rules support selecting a minimal
dataset to fulfill the Verifier's request in a privacy-friendly manner
(see <xref target="privacy-considerations"></xref> for additional considerations). Wallets MUST NOT send
selectively disclosable claims that have not been selected according to the rules below.
A single Presentation of a Credential MAY contain more than the claims selected in the
particular DCQL Credential Query if the same Credential is selected with the additional
claims in a separate Credential Query in the same request, or the additional claims are
not selectively disclosable.</t>

<section anchor="selecting_claims"><name>Selecting Claims</name>
<t>The following rules apply for selecting claims via <tt>claims</tt> and <tt>claim_sets</tt>:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>If <tt>claims</tt> is absent, the Verifier is requesting no claims that are selectively disclosable; the Wallet MUST
return only the claims that are mandatory to present (e.g., SD-JWT and Key Binding JWT for a Credential
of format IETF SD-JWT VC).</li>
<li>If <tt>claims</tt> is present, but <tt>claim_sets</tt> is absent,
the Verifier requests all claims listed in <tt>claims</tt>.</li>
<li>If both <tt>claims</tt> and <tt>claim_sets</tt> are present, the Verifier requests one combination of the claims listed in
<tt>claim_sets</tt>. The order of the options conveyed in the <tt>claim_sets</tt>
array expresses the Verifier's preference for what is returned; the Wallet SHOULD return
the first option that it can satisfy. If the Wallet cannot satisfy any of the
options, it MUST NOT return any claims.</li>
<li><tt>claim_sets</tt> MUST NOT be present if <tt>claims</tt> is absent.</li>
</ul>
<t>When a Claims Query contains a restriction on the values of a claim, the Wallet
SHOULD NOT return the claim if its value does not match according to the rules for
<tt>values</tt> defined in <xref target="claims_query"></xref>, i.e.,
the claim should be treated the same as if it did not
exist in the Credential. Implementing this restriction may not be possible in
all cases, for example, if the Wallet does not have access to the claim value
before presentation or user consent or if another component routing
the request to the Wallet does not have access to the claim value. It is ultimately up to the
Wallet and/or the End-User if the value matching request
is followed. Therefore, Verifiers MUST treat restrictions expressed using <tt>values</tt> as a
best-effort way to improve user privacy, but MUST NOT rely on it for security checks.</t>
<t>The purpose of the <tt>claim_sets</tt> syntax is to provide a way for a verifier to
describe alternative ways a given credential can satisfy the request. The array
ordering expresses the Verifier's preference for how to fulfill the request. The
first element in the array is the most preferred and the last element in the
array is the least preferred. Verifiers SHOULD use the principle of least
information disclosure to influence how they order these options. For example, a
proof of age request should prioritize requesting an attribute like
<tt>age_over_18</tt> over an attribute like <tt>birth_date</tt>. The <tt>claim_sets</tt> syntax is
not intended to define options the user can choose from, see <xref target="dcql_query_ui"></xref> for
more information. The Wallet is recommended to return the first option it can satisfy
since that is the preferred option from the Verifier. However, there can be reasons to
deviate. Non-exhaustive examples of such reasons are:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>scenarios where the Verifier did not order the options according to least information disclosure</li>
<li>operational reasons why returning a different option than the first option has UX benefits for the Wallet.</li>
</ul>
<t>If the Wallet cannot deliver all claims requested by the Verifier
according to these rules, it MUST NOT return the respective Credential.</t>
<t>For Credential Formats that do not support selective disclosure, the case of both <tt>claims</tt>
and <tt>claim_sets</tt> being absent is interpreted as requesting a presentation of the &quot;full credential&quot;
since all claims are mandatory to present.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="selecting-credentials"><name>Selecting Credentials</name>
<t>The following rules apply for selecting Credentials via <tt>credentials</tt> and <tt>credential_sets</tt>:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>If <tt>credential_sets</tt> is not provided, the Verifier requests presentations for all
Credentials in <tt>credentials</tt> to be returned.</li>
<li><t>Otherwise, the Verifier requests presentations of Credentials to be returned satisfying</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>all of the Credential Set Queries in the <tt>credential_sets</tt> array where the <tt>required</tt> attribute is true or omitted, and</li>
<li>optionally, any of the other Credential Set Queries.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<t>To satisfy a Credential Set Query, the Wallet MUST return presentations of a
set of Credentials that match to one of the <tt>options</tt> inside the
Credential Set Query.</t>
<t>Credentials not matching the respective constraints expressed within
<tt>credentials</tt> MUST NOT be returned, i.e., they are treated as if
they would not exist in the Wallet.</t>
<t>If the Wallet cannot deliver all non-optional Credentials requested by the
Verifier according to these rules, it MUST NOT return any Credential(s).</t>

<section anchor="dcql_query_ui"><name>User Interface Considerations</name>
<t>While this specification provides the mechanisms for requesting different sets
of claims and Credentials, it does not define details about the user interface
of the Wallet, for example, if and how users can select which combination of
Credentials to present. However, it is typically expected that the Wallet
presents the End-User with a choice of which Credential(s) to present if
multiple of the sets of Credentials in <tt>options</tt> can satisfy the request.</t>

<section anchor="claims_path_pointer"><name>Claims Path Pointer</name>
<t>A claims path pointer is a pointer into the Credential, identifying one or more claims.
A claims path pointer MUST be a non-empty array of strings, nulls and non-negative integers.
A claims path pointer can be processed, which means it is applied to a Credential. The results of
processing are the referenced claims.</t>

<section anchor="semantics-for-json-based-credentials"><name>Semantics for JSON-based credentials</name>
<t>This section defines the semantics of a claims path pointer when applied to a JSON-based Credential.</t>
<t>A string value indicates that the respective key is to be selected, a null value
indicates that all elements of the currently selected array(s) are to be selected;
and a non-negative integer indicates that the respective index in an array is to be selected. The path
is formed as follows:</t>
<t>Start with an empty array and repeat the following until the full path is formed.</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>To address a particular claim within an object, append the key (claim name)
to the array.</li>
<li>To address an element within an array, append the index to the array (as a
non-negative, 0-based integer).</li>
<li>To address all elements within an array, append a null value to the array.</li>
</ul>

<section anchor="processing"><name>Processing</name>
<t>In detail, the array is processed from left to right as follows:</t>

<t>A claims path pointer into an mdoc contains two elements of type string. The
first element refers to a namespace and the second element refers to a data
element identifier.</t>

<section anchor="processing-1"><name>Processing</name>
<t>In detail, the array is processed as follows:</t>

<section anchor="response_mode_post"><name>Response Mode &quot;direct_post&quot;</name>
<t>The Response Mode <tt>direct_post</tt> allows the Wallet to send the Authorization Response to an endpoint controlled by the Verifier via an HTTP POST request.</t>
<t>It has been defined to address the following use cases:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>Verifier and Wallet are located on different devices; thus, the Wallet cannot send the Authorization Response to the Verifier using a redirect.</li>
<li>The Authorization Response size exceeds the URL length limits of user agents, so flows relying only on redirects (such as Response Mode <tt>fragment</tt>) cannot be used. In those cases, the Response Mode <tt>direct_post</tt> is the way to convey the Presentations to the Verifier without the need for the Wallet to have a backend.</li>
</ul>
<t>The Response Mode is defined in accordance with <xref target="OAuth.Responses"></xref> as follows:</t>

<dl spacing="compact">
<dt><tt>direct_post</tt>:</dt>
<dd>In this mode, the Authorization Response is sent to the Verifier using an HTTP POST request to an endpoint controlled by the Verifier. The Authorization Response MUST be encoded in the request body using the format defined by the <tt>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</tt> HTTP content type. The parameters in the request body MUST all be encoded using UTF-8. The verifier can request that the wallet redirects the user to the verifier using the response as defined below.</dd>
</dl>
<t>The following new Authorization Request parameter is defined to be used in conjunction with Response Mode <tt>direct_post</tt>:</t>

<dl spacing="compact">
<dt><tt>response_uri</tt>:</dt>
<dd>REQUIRED when the Response Mode <tt>direct_post</tt> is used. The URL to which the Wallet MUST send the Authorization Response using an HTTP POST request as defined by the Response Mode <tt>direct_post</tt>. The Response URI receives all Authorization Response parameters as defined by the respective Response Type. When the <tt>response_uri</tt> parameter is present, the <tt>redirect_uri</tt> Authorization Request parameter MUST NOT be present. If the <tt>redirect_uri</tt> Authorization Request parameter is present when the Response Mode is <tt>direct_post</tt>, the Wallet MUST return an <tt>invalid_request</tt> Authorization Response error. The <tt>response_uri</tt> value MUST be a value that the client would be permitted to use as <tt>redirect_uri</tt> when following the rules defined in <xref target="client_metadata_management"></xref>.</dd>
</dl>
<t>Note: When the specification text refers to the usage of Redirect URI in the Authorization Request, that part of the text also applies when Response URI is used in the Authorization Request with Response Mode <tt>direct_post</tt>.</t>
<t>Note: The Verifier's component providing the user interface (Frontend) and the Verifier's component providing the Response URI need to be able to map authorization requests to the respective authorization responses. The Verifier MAY use the <tt>state</tt> Authorization Request parameter to add appropriate data to the Authorization Response for that purpose, for details see <xref target="implementation_considerations_direct_post"></xref>.</t>
<t>Additional request parameters MAY be defined and used with the Response Mode <tt>direct_post</tt>.
The Wallet MUST ignore any unrecognized parameters.</t>
<t>The following is a non-normative example of the payload of a Request Object with Response Mode <tt>direct_post</tt>:</t>

<sourcecode type="json">{

  error=invalid_request&amp;
  error_description=unsupported%20client_id_prefix&amp;
  state=eyJhb...6-sVA
</artwork>
<t>If the Response URI has successfully processed the Authorization Response or Authorization Error Response, it MUST respond with an HTTP status code of 200 with <tt>Content-Type</tt> of <tt>application/json</tt> and a JSON object in the response body.</t>
<t>The following new parameter is defined for use in the JSON object returned from the Response Endpoint to the Wallet:</t>

<dl spacing="compact">
<dt><tt>redirect_uri</tt>:</dt>
<dd>OPTIONAL. String containing a URI. When this parameter is present the Wallet MUST redirect the user agent to this URI. This allows the Verifier to continue the interaction with the End-User on the device where the Wallet resides after the Wallet has sent the Authorization Response to the Response URI. It can be used by the Verifier to prevent session fixation (<xref target="session_fixation"></xref>) attacks. The Response URI MAY return the <tt>redirect_uri</tt> parameter in response to successful Authorization Responses or for Error Responses.</dd>
</dl>
<t>Additional response parameters MAY be defined and used. The Wallet MUST ignore any unrecognized parameters.</t>
<t>Note: Response Mode <tt>direct_post</tt> without the <tt>redirect_uri</tt> could be less secure than Response Modes with redirects. For details, see (<xref target="session_fixation"></xref>).</t>
<t>The value of the redirect URI is an absolute URI as defined by <xref target="RFC3986"></xref> Section 4.3 and is chosen by the Verifier. The Verifier MUST include a fresh, cryptographically random value in the URL. This value is used to ensure only the receiver of the redirect can fetch and process the Authorization Response. The value can be added as a path component, as a fragment or as a parameter to the URL. It is RECOMMENDED to use a cryptographic random value of 128 bits or more. For implementation considerations see <xref target="implementation_considerations_direct_post"></xref>.</t>
<t>The following is a non-normative example of the response from the Verifier to the Wallet upon receiving the Authorization Response at the Response URI (using a <tt>response_code</tt> parameter from <xref target="implementation_considerations_direct_post"></xref>):</t>

}
</artwork>
<t>If the response does not contain the <tt>redirect_uri</tt> parameter, the Wallet is not required to perform any further steps.</t>
<t>Note: In the Response Mode <tt>direct_post</tt> or <tt>direct_post.jwt</tt>, the Wallet can change the UI based on the Verifier's callback to the Wallet following the submission of the Authorization Response.</t>
<t>Additional parameters MAY be defined and used in the response from the Response Endpoint to the Wallet.
The Wallet MUST ignore any unrecognized parameters.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="response_encryption"><name>Encrypted Responses</name>
<t>This section defines how an Authorization Response containing a VP Token (such as when the Response Type value is <tt>vp_token</tt> or <tt>vp_token id_token</tt>) can be encrypted at the application level using <xref target="RFC7518"></xref> where the payload of the JWE is a JSON object containing the Authorization Response parameters. Encrypting the Authorization Response can, for example, prevent personal data in the Authorization Response from leaking, when the Authorization Response is returned through the front channel (e.g., the browser).</t>
<t>To encrypt the Authorization Response, implementations MUST use an unsigned, encrypted JWT as described in <xref target="RFC7519"></xref>.</t>
<t>To obtain the Verifier's public key to which to encrypt the Authorization Response, the Wallet uses keys from client metadata, such as the <tt>jwks</tt> member within the <tt>client_metadata</tt> request parameter, the metadata defined in the Entity Configuration if OpenID Federation is used, or other mechanisms.
Using what it supports and its preferences, the Wallet selects the public key to encrypt the Authorization Response based on information about each key, such as the <tt>kty</tt> (Key Type), <tt>use</tt> (Public Key Use), <tt>alg</tt> (Algorithm), and other JWK parameters.
The JWE <tt>alg</tt> algorithm used MUST the <tt>alg</tt> value of the chosen <tt>jwk</tt>, if present, or otherwise make sense to use with the selected key.
If the selected public key contains a <tt>kid</tt> parameter, the JWE MUST include the same value in the <tt>kid</tt> JWE Header Parameter (as defined in <xref target="RFC7516" sectionFormat="bare" relative="#" section="Section 4.1.6"></xref>) of the encrypted response. This enables the Verifier to easily identify the specific public key that used to encrypt the response.
The JWE <tt>enc</tt> content encryption algorithm used is obtained from the <tt>authorization_encrypted_response_enc</tt> parameter of client metadata, such as the <tt>client_metadata</tt> request parameter, allowing for the default value of <tt>A128CBC-HS256</tt> when not explictiy set.</t>
<t>The payload of the encrypted JWT response MUST include the contents of the response as defined in <xref target="response-parameters"></xref> as top-level JSON members.</t>
<t>The following is a non-normative example of the payload of a JWT used in an encrypted Authorization Response:</t>

<sourcecode type="json">{
 &quot;vp_token&quot;: {&quot;example_credential_id&quot;: [&quot;eyJhb...YMetA&quot;]}
}
</sourcecode>
<t>Note that for the ECDH JWE algorithms (from Section 4.6 of <xref target="RFC7518"></xref>), the <tt>apu</tt> and <tt>apv</tt> values are inputs
into the key derivation process that is used to derive the content encryption key. Regardless of algorithm used, the values are always part of the AEAD tag computation so will still be bound to the encrypted response.</t>
<t>Note: For encryption, implementers have a variety of options available through JOSE, including the use of Hybrid Public Key Encryption (HPKE) as detailed in <xref target="I-D.ietf-jose-hpke-encrypt"></xref>.</t>

<section anchor="direct_post_jwt"><name>Response Mode &quot;direct_post.jwt&quot;</name>
<t>This specification also defines a new Response Mode <tt>direct_post.jwt</tt>, which allows for encryption to be used with Response Mode <tt>direct_post</tt> defined in <xref target="response_mode_post"></xref>.</t>
<t>The Response Mode <tt>direct_post.jwt</tt> causes the Wallet to send the Authorization Response using an HTTP POST request instead of redirecting back to the Verifier as defined in <xref target="response_mode_post"></xref>. The Wallet adds the <tt>response</tt> parameter containing the JWT as defined in <xref target="response_encryption"></xref> in the body of an HTTP POST request using the <tt>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</tt> content type. The names and values in the body MUST be encoded using UTF-8.</t>
<t>If a Wallet is unable to generate an encrypted response, it MAY send an error response without as per <xref target="response_mode_post"></xref>.</t>

<section anchor="transaction_data"><name>Transaction Data</name>
<t>The transaction data mechanism enables a binding between the user's identification/authentication and the user’s authorization, for example to complete a payment transaction, or to sign specific document(s) using QES (Qualified Electronic Signatures). This is achieved by signing the transaction data used for user authorization with the user-controlled key used for proof of possession of the Credential being presented as a means for user identification/authentication.</t>
<t>The Wallet that received the <tt>transaction_data</tt> parameter in the request MUST include a representation or reference to the data in the respective credential presentation. How this is done is transaction data type specific. Credential Formats can give recommendations of how to handle transaction data, such as those in <xref target="format_specific_parameters"></xref>.</t>

For example, this applies when using claimed HTTPS URIs handled by the Wallet provider in case the platform cannot or does not translate the URI into a platform intent to invoke the Wallet. In this case, the Wallet provider would return the Authorization Error Response to the Verifier and might redirect the user agent back to the Verifier website.</li>

<t>The Verifier can use one of the following mechanisms to invoke a Wallet:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>Custom URL scheme as an <tt>authorization_endpoint</tt> (for example, <tt>openid4vp://</tt> as defined in <xref target="openid4vp-scheme"></xref>)</li>

<t>The Wallet can also be invoked from the web or a native app using the Digital Credentials API as described in <xref target="dc_api"></xref>. As described in detail in <xref target="dc_api"></xref>, DC API provides privacy, security (see <xref target="session_fixation"></xref>), and user experience benefits (particularly in the cases where a user has multiple Wallets).</t>

</section>

<section anchor="verifier_attestation_jwt"><name>Verifier Attestation JWT</name>
<t>The Verifier Attestation JWT is a JWT especially designed to allow a Wallet to authenticate a Verifier in a secure and flexible manner. A Verifier Attestation JWT is issued to the Verifier by a party that wallets trust for the purpose of authentication and authorization of Verifiers. The way this trust established is out of scope of this specification. Every Verifier is bound to a public key, the Verifier MUST always present a Verifier Attestation JWT along with the proof of possession for this key. In the case of the Client Identifier Prefix <tt>verifier_attestation</tt>, the authorization request is signed with this key, which serves as proof of possession.</t>
<t>A Verifier Attestation JWT MUST contain the following claims:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li><tt>iss</tt>: REQUIRED. This claim identifies the issuer of the Verifier Attestation JWT. The <tt>iss</tt> value MAY be used to retrieve the issuer's public key. How the trust is established between Wallet and Issuer and how the public key is obtained for validating the attestation's signature is out of scope of this specification.</li>
<li><tt>sub</tt>: REQUIRED. The value of this claim MUST be the <tt>client_id</tt> of the client making the credential request.</li>
<li><tt>iat</tt>: OPTIONAL. A number representing the time at which the Verifier Attestation JWT was issued using the syntax defined in [RFC7519].</li>
<li><tt>exp</tt>: REQUIRED. A number representing the time at which the Verifier Attestation JWT expires using the syntax defined in [RFC7519]. The Wallet MUST reject any Verifier Attestation JWT with an expiration time that has passed, subject to allowable clock skew between systems.</li>
<li><tt>nbf</tt>: OPTIONAL. A number representing the time before which the token MUST NOT be accepted for processing.</li>
<li><tt>cnf</tt>: REQUIRED. This claim contains the confirmation method as defined in <xref target="RFC7800"></xref>. It MUST contain a JSON Web Key <xref target="RFC7517"></xref> as defined in Section 3.2 of <xref target="RFC7800"></xref>. This claim determines the public key for which's corresponding private key the Verifier MUST proof possession of when presenting the Verifier Attestation JWT. This additional security measure allows the Verifier to obtain a Verifier Attestation JWT from a trusted issuer and use it for a long time independent of that issuer without the risk of an adversary impersonating the Verifier by replaying a captured attestation.</li>
</ul>
<t>Additional claims MAY be defined and used in the Verifier Attestation JWT,
as described in <xref target="RFC7519"></xref>.
The Wallet MUST ignore any unrecognized claims.</t>
<t>Verifier Attestation JWTs compliant with this specification MUST use the media type <tt>application/verifier-attestation+jwt</tt> as defined in <xref target="va_media_type"></xref>.</t>
<t>A Verifier Attestation JWT MUST set the <tt>typ</tt> JOSE header to <tt>verifier-attestation+jwt</tt>.</t>
<t>The Verifier Attestation JWT MAY be conveyed in the header of a JWS signed object (JOSE header).</t>
<t>This specification introduces a JOSE header, which can be used to add a JWT to such a header as follows:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li><tt>jwt</tt>: This JOSE header MUST contain a JWT.</li>
</ul>
<t>In the context of this specification, such a JWT MUST set the <tt>typ</tt> JOSE header to <tt>verifier-attestation+jwt</tt>.</t>

<t>(1) The Verifier produces a <tt>nonce</tt> value by generating at least 16 fresh, cryptographically random bytes with sufficient entropy, associates it with the session and base64url encodes it.</t>
<t>(2) The Verifier initiates a new transaction at its Response URI.</t>
<t>(3) The Response URI will set up the transaction and respond with two fresh, cryptographically random numbers with sufficient entropy designated as <tt>transaction-id</tt> and <tt>request-id</tt>. Those values are used in the process to identify the authorization response (<tt>request-id</tt>) and to ensure only the Verifier can obtain the Authorization Response data (<tt>transaction-id</tt>).</t>
<t>(4) The Verifier then sends the Authorization Request with the <tt>request-id</tt> as <tt>state</tt> and the <tt>nonce</tt> value created in step (1) to the Wallet.</t>
<t>(5) After authenticating the End-User and getting their consent to share the request Credentials, the Wallet sends the Authorization Response with the parameters <tt>vp_token</tt> and <tt>state</tt> to the <tt>response_uri</tt> of the Verifier.</t>
<t>(6) The Verifier's Response URI checks whether the <tt>state</tt> value is a valid <tt>request-id</tt>. If so, it stores the Authorization Response data linked to the respective <tt>transaction-id</tt>. It then creates a <tt>response_code</tt> as fresh, cryptographically random number with sufficient entropy that it also links with the respective Authorization Response data. It then returns the <tt>redirect_uri</tt>, which includes the <tt>response_code</tt> to the Wallet.</t>
<t>Note: If the Verifier's Response URI does not return a <tt>redirect_uri</tt>, processing at the Wallet stops at that step. The Verifier is supposed to fetch the Authorization Response without waiting for a redirect (see step 8).</t>
<t>(7) The Wallet sends the user agent to the Verifier (<tt>redirect_uri</tt>). The Verifier receives the Request and extracts the <tt>response_code</tt> parameter.</t>
<t>(8) The Verifier sends the <tt>response_code</tt> and the <tt>transaction-id</tt> from its session to the Response URI.</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>The Response URI uses the <tt>transaction-id</tt> to look the matching Authorization Response data up, which implicitly validates the <tt>transaction-id</tt> associated with the Verifier's session.</li>
<li>If an Authorization Response is found, the Response URI checks whether the <tt>response_code</tt> was associated with this Authorization Response in step (6).</li>

<t>Note: If the Verifier's Response URI did not return a <tt>redirect_uri</tt> in step (6), the Verifier will periodically query the Response URI with the <tt>transaction-id</tt> to obtain the Authorization Response once it becomes available.</t>

<section anchor="security_considerations"><name>Security Considerations</name>

<section anchor="preventing-replay"><name>Preventing Replay of Verifiable Presentations</name>
<t>An attacker could try to inject Presentations obtained from (for example) a previous Authorization Response into another Authorization Response, thus impersonating the End-User that originally presented the respective Verifiable Presentation. Holder Binding aims to prevent such attacks.</t>

<section anchor="presentations-without-holder-binding"><name>Presentations without Holder Binding Proofs</name>
<t>By definition, Presentations without Holder Binding (see <xref target="nkb-credentials"></xref>) do
not provide protection against replay. A Verifier that consumes Presentations without Holder Binding
accepts the risk that the Holder may have obtained the Credential from a third
party (e.g., by playing the role of a Verifier) and that the Holder may not be
the subject of the Credential.</t>
<t>Depending on the use case, the risk assessment of the Verifier, and external
validation measures that can be taken, this risk may be acceptable.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="verifiable-presentations-considerations"><name>Verifiable Presentations</name>
<t>For Verifiable Presentations, implementers of this specification MUST implement the controls as defined in this section to detect and prevent replay attacks.</t>
<t>The cryptographic proof of possession in a Verifiable Presentation MUST be bound by the Wallet to the intended audience (the Client Identifier of the Verifier) and the respective transaction (identified by the <tt>nonce</tt> parameter in the Authorization Request, as defined in <xref target="existing_parameters"></xref>). The Verifier MUST verify this binding.</t>
<t>The Wallet MUST link every Verifiable Presentation returned to the Verifier in the VP Token to the <tt>client_id</tt> and the <tt>nonce</tt> values of the respective Authentication Request.</t>
<t>The Verifier MUST validate every individual Verifiable Presentation in an Authorization Response and ensure that it is linked to the values of the <tt>client_id</tt> and the <tt>nonce</tt> parameter it had used for the respective Authorization Request. If any Verifiable Presentation in the response does not contain the correct <tt>nonce</tt> value, the response MUST be rejected.</t>
<t>The <tt>client_id</tt> is used to detect the replay of Verifiable Presentations to a party other than the one intended. This allows Verifiers to reject the Verifiable Presentation. The <tt>nonce</tt> value binds the Verifiable Presentation to a certain authentication transaction and allows the Verifier to detect injection of a Presentation in the flow, which is especially important in the flows where the Presentation is passed through the front-channel.</t>
<t>Note: Different formats for Verifiable Presentations and signature/proof schemes use different ways to represent the intended audience and the session binding. Some use claims to directly represent those values, others include the values into the calculation of cryptographic proofs. There are also different naming conventions across the different formats. The format of the respective presentation is defined by the Verifier in the request.</t>
<t>The following is a non-normative example of the payload of a Verifiable Presentation following a request with the Credential Format Identifier <tt>jwt_vc_json</tt>:</t>

<sourcecode type="json">{

</section>

<section anchor="session_fixation"><name>Session Fixation</name>
<t>To perform a Session Fixation attack, an attacker would start the process using a Verifier executed on a device under his control, capture the Authorization Request and relay it to the device of a victim. The attacker would then periodically try to conclude the process in his Verifier, which would cause the Verifier on his device to try to fetch and verify the Authorization Response.</t>
<t>Such an attack is impossible against flows implemented with the Response Mode <tt>fragment</tt> as the Wallet will always send the VP Token to the redirect endpoint on the same device where it resides. This means an attacker could extract a valid Authorization Request from a Verifier on his device and trick a Victim into performing the same Authorization Request on her device. But there is usually no way for an attacker to get hold of the resulting VP Token.</t>
<t>However, the Response Mode <tt>direct_post</tt> is susceptible to such an attack as the result is sent from the Wallet out-of-band to the Verifier's Response URI.</t>
<t>This kind of attack can be detected if the Response Mode <tt>direct_post</tt> is used in conjunction with the redirect URI, which causes the Wallet to redirect the flow to the Verifier's frontend at the device where the transaction was concluded. The Verifier's Response URI MUST include a fresh secret (Response Code) into the redirect URI returned to the Wallet and the Verifier's Response URI MUST require the frontend to pass the respective Response Code when fetching the Authorization Response. That stops session fixation attacks as long as the attacker is unable to get access to the Response Code.</t>
<t>Note that this protection technique is not applicable to cross-device scenarios because the browser used by the wallet will not have the original session.
It is also not applicable in same-device scenarios if the Wallet uses a browser different from the one used on the presentation request (e.g. device with multiple installed browsers), because the original session will also not be available there. <xref target="dc_api"></xref> provides an alternative Wallet invocation method using web/app platform APIs that avoids many of these issues.</t>
<t>See <xref target="implementation_considerations_direct_post"></xref> for more implementation considerations.</t>
<t>When using the Response Mode <tt>direct_post</tt> without the further protection provided by the redirect URI, there is no session context for the Verifier to detect session fixation attempts. It is RECOMMENDED for the Verifiers to implement mechanisms to strengthen the security of the flow. For more details on possible attacks and mitigations see <xref target="I-D.ietf-oauth-cross-device-security"></xref>.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="security_considerations_direct_post"><name>Response Mode &quot;direct_post&quot;</name>

<section anchor="validation-of-the-response-uri"><name>Validation of the Response URI</name>
<t>The Wallet MUST ensure the data in the Authorization Response cannot leak through Response URIs. When using pre-registered Response URIs, the Wallet MUST comply with best practices for redirect URI validation as defined in <xref target="RFC9700"></xref>. The Wallet MAY also rely on a Client Identifier Prefix in conjunction with Client Authentication and integrity protection of the request to establish trust in the Response URI provided by a certain Verifier.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="protection-of-the-response-uri"><name>Protection of the Response URI</name>
<t>The Verifier SHOULD protect its Response URI from inadvertent requests by checking that the value of the received <tt>state</tt> parameter corresponds to a recent Authorization Request.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="protection-of-the-authorization-response-data"><name>Protection of the Authorization Response Data</name>
<t>This specification assumes that the Verifier's Response URI offers an internal interface to other components of the Verifier to obtain (and subsequently process) Authorization Response data. An attacker could try to obtain Authorization Response Data from a Verifier's Response URI by looking up this data through the internal interface. This could lead to leakage of valid Presentations containing personally identifiable information.</t>
<t>Implementations of this specification MUST have security mechanisms in place to prevent inadvertent requests against this internal interface. Implementation options to fulfill this requirement include:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>Authentication between the different parts within the Verifier</li>
<li>Two cryptographically random numbers.  The first being used to manage state between the Wallet and Verifier. The second being used to ensure that only a legitimate component of the Verifier can obtain the Authorization Response data.</li>
</ul>
</section>
</section>

<section anchor="end-user-authentication-using-credentials"><name>End-User Authentication using Credentials</name>
<t>Clients intending to authenticate the End-User utilizing a claim in a Credential MUST ensure this claim is stable for the End-User as well locally unique and never reassigned within the Credential Issuer to another End-User. Such a claim MUST also only be used in combination with the Credential Issuer identifier to ensure global uniqueness and to prevent attacks where an attacker obtains the same claim from a different Credential Issuer and tries to impersonate the legitimate End-User.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="encrypting_unsigned_response"><name>Encrypting an Unsigned Response</name>
<t>Because an encrypted Authorization Response has no additional integrity protection, an attacker might be able to alter Authorization Response parameters and generate a new encrypted Authorization Response for the Verifier, as encryption is performed using the public key of the Verifier (which is likely to be widely known when not ephemeral to the request/response). Note this includes injecting a new VP Token. Since the contents of the VP Token are integrity protected, tampering the VP Token is detectable by the Verifier. For details, see <xref target="preventing-replay"></xref>.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="tls-requirements"><name>TLS Requirements</name>
<t>Implementations MUST follow <xref target="BCP195"></xref>.</t>
<t>Whenever TLS is used, a TLS server certificate check MUST be performed, per <xref target="RFC6125"></xref>.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="incomplete-or-incorrect-implementations-of-the-specifications-and-conformance-testing"><name>Incomplete or Incorrect Implementations of the Specifications and Conformance Testing</name>
<t>To achieve the full security benefits, it is important that the implementation of this specification, and the underlying specifications, are both complete and correct.</t>
<t>The OpenID Foundation provides tools that can be used to confirm that an implementation is correct and conformant:</t>
<t><eref target="https://openid.net/certification/conformance-testing-for-openid-for-verifiable-presentations/">https://openid.net/certification/conformance-testing-for-openid-for-verifiable-presentations/</eref></t>
</section>

<section anchor="full-client-identifier"><name>Always Use the Full Client Identifier</name>
<t>Confusing Verifiers using a Client Identifier Prefix with those using none can lead to attacks. Therefore, Wallets MUST always use the full Client Identifier, including the prefix if provided, within the context of the Wallet or its responses to identify the client. This refers in particular to places where the Client Identifier is used in <xref target="RFC6749"></xref> and in the presentation returned to the Verifier.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="dcql_query_security"><name>Security Checks on the Returned Credentials and Presentations</name>
<t>While the Verifier can specify various constraints both on the claims level and
the Credential level as shown in <xref target="dcql_query_lang_processing_rules"></xref>, it MUST NOT rely on the Wallet to enforce
these constraints. The Wallet is not controlled by the Verifier and the Verifier
MUST perform its own security checks on the returned Credentials and
Presentations.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="dcql-value-matching"><name>DCQL Value Matching</name>
<t>When using DCQL <tt>values</tt> to match the expected values of claims, the fact that a
claim within a certain credential matched a value or did not match a value might
already leak information about the claim value. Therefore, Wallets MUST take
precautions against leaking information about the claim value when processing
<tt>values</tt>. This SHOULD include, in particular:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>ensuring that a Verifier, in the response, cannot distinguish between the case where a user did
not consent to releasing the credential and the case where the claim value did
not match the expected value, and</li>
<li>preventing repeated or &quot;silent&quot; requests leaking data to the Verifier without
the user's consent by ensuring that all requests, even if no response can be
sent by the Wallet due to a <tt>values</tt> mismatch, require some form of user
interaction before a response is sent.</li>
</ul>
<t>In both cases listed here, it needs to be considered that returning an error
response can also leak information about the processing outcome of <tt>values</tt>.</t>
</section>
</section>

<section anchor="privacy-considerations"><name>Privacy Considerations</name>
<t>Many privacy considerations are specific to the credential format and associated proof type used in any particular presentation.
This section focuses on privacy considerations that are specific to the presentation protocol with some treatment also
given to considerations that apply across some common credential formats.</t>

<section anchor="seletive-disclosure"><name>Selective Disclosure</name>
<t>Selective disclosure is a data minimization technique that allows for sharing only the specific information needed from
a credential without revealing everything.</t>
<t>The DCQL helps facilitate selective disclosure by allowing the Verifier to specify the claims it is interested in,
allowing the Wallet to disclose only the claims that are relevant to the Verifier's request.</t>
<t>Some credential formats support selective disclosure and a salted-hash based approach is one common approach.
Considerable discourse regarding unlinkability in salted-hash based selective disclosure mechanisms is provided in
<xref target="I-D.ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt" sectionFormat="of" relative="#" section="10.1"></xref>. One technique mentioned to achieve some important
unlinkability properties is the use of batch issuance, which is supported in <xref target="OpenID4VCI"></xref>, with individual credentials
being presented only once.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="authorization-requests-with-request-uri"><name>Authorization Requests with Request URI</name>
<t>If the Wallet is acting within a trust framework that allows the Wallet to determine whether a 'request_uri' belongs to a certain 'client_id', the Wallet is RECOMMENDED to validate the Verifier's authenticity and authorization given by 'client_id' and that the 'request_uri' corresponds to this Verifier. If the link cannot be established in those cases, the Wallet SHOULD refuse the request or ask the End-User for advise.</t>
<t>If no End-User interaction is required before sending the request, it is easy to request on a large scale and in an automated fashion the wallet capabilities from all visitors of a website. Even without personally identifiable information (PII) this can reveal some information about End-Users, like their nationality (e.g., a Wallet with special capabilities only used in one EU member state).</t>
<t>Mandatory End-User interaction before sending the request, like clicking a button, unlocking the wallet or even just showing a screen of the app, can make this less attractive/likely to being exploited.</t>
<t>Requests from the Wallet to the Verifier SHOULD be sent with the minimal amount of information possible, and in particular, without any HTTP headers identifying the software used for the request (e.g., HTTP libraries or their versions). The Wallet MUST NOT send PII or any other data that could be used for fingerprinting to the Request URI in order to prevent End-User tracking.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="authorization-error-response-with-the-wallet-unavailable-error-code"><name>Authorization Error Response with the <tt>wallet_unavailable</tt> error code</name>
<t>In the event that another component is invoked instead of the Wallet, the End-User MUST be informed and give consent before the invoked component returns the <tt>wallet_unavailable</tt> Authorization Error Response to the Verifier.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="privacy_trusted_authorities"><name>Privacy implications of mechanisms to establish trust in Issuers</name>
<t>This specification introduces an extension point that allows for a Verifier to express expected Issuers or trust frameworks that certify Issuers.
It is important to understand the implications that different mechanism to establish trust in Issuers can have on the privacy of the overall system.</t>
<t>Generally speaking, a distinction can be made between self-contained mechanisms, where all information necessary to validate if a credential matches the request is already present in the Wallet and Verifier, and those mechanisms that require some form of online resolution.
Mechanisms that require online resolution can leak information that could be used to profile the usage of credentials and the overall ecosystem.</t>
<t>Especially the case where a Wallet has to retrieve information before being able to construct a presentation that matches the request could leak information about individual users to other parties.
Wallets SHOULD NOT fetch URLs provided by the Verifier in a request that are unknown to the Wallet or hosted by a third party that the Wallet does not trust. The privacy concerns can be mitigated if the URLs are only used by the Wallet as identifiers but not fetched upon receiving the request from the Verifier.</t>
<t>Ecosystems that plan to leverage the trusted authorities mechanisms SHOULD make sure that the privacy properties of the mechanisms they choose to support matches with the desired privacy properties of the overall ecosystem.</t>

<section anchor="dc_api"><name>OpenID4VP over the Digital Credentials API</name>
<t>This section defines how to use OpenID4VP with the Digital Credentials API.</t>
<t>The name &quot;Digital Credentials API&quot; (DC API) encompasses the W3C Digital Credentials API <xref target="W3C.Digital_Credentials_API"></xref>
as well as its native App Platform equivalents in operating systems (such as <eref target="https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/credentials">Credential Manager on Android</eref>).
The DC API allows web sites and native apps acting as Verifiers to request the presentation of Credentials.
The API itself is agnostic to the Credential exchange protocol and can be used with different protocols.
The Web Platform, working in conjunction with other layers, such as the app platform/operating system, and based on the permission of the End-User, will send the request data along with the Origin of the Verifier to the End-User's chosen Wallet.</t>
<t>OpenID4VP over the DC API utilizes the mechanisms of the DC API while also allowing to leverage advanced security features of OpenID4VP, if needed.
It also defines the OpenID4VP request parameters that MAY be used with the DC API.</t>
<t>The DC API offers several advantages for implementers of both Verifiers and Wallets.</t>
<t>Firstly, the API serves as a privacy-preserving alternative to invoking Wallets via URLs, particularly custom URL schemes. The underlying app platform will only invoke a Wallet if the End-User confirms the request based on contextual information about the Credential Request and the requestor (Verifier).</t>
<t>Secondly, the session with the End-User will always continue in the initial context, typically a web browser tab, when the request has been fulfilled (or aborted), which results in an improved user experience.</t>
<t>Thirdly, cross-device requests benefit from the use of secure transports with proximity checks, which are handled by the OS platform, e.g., using FIDO CTAP 2.2 with hybrid transports.</t>
<t>And lastly, as part of the request, the Wallet is provided with information about the Verifier's Origin as authenticated by the user agent, which is important for phishing resistance.</t>

<section anchor="protocol"><name>Protocol</name>
<t>To use OpenID4VP with the Digital Credentials API (DC API), the exchange protocol value has the following format: <tt>openid4vp-v&lt;version&gt;-&lt;request-type&gt;</tt>. The <tt>&lt;version&gt;</tt> field is a numeric value, and <tt>&lt;request-type&gt;</tt> explicitly specifies the type of request. This approach eliminates the need for Wallets to perform implicit parameter matching to accurately identify the version and the expected request and response parameters.</t>
<t>The value <tt>1</tt> MUST be used for the <tt>&lt;version&gt;</tt> field to indicate the request and response are compatible with this version of the specification. For <tt>&lt;request-type&gt;</tt>, unsigned requests, as defined in <xref target="unsigned_request"></xref>, MUST use <tt>unsigned</tt>, and signed requests, as defined in <xref target="signed_request"></xref>, MUST use <tt>signed</tt>.</t>
<t>The following exchange protocol values are defined by this specification:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>Unsigned requests: <tt>openid4vp-v1-unsigned</tt></li>
<li>Signed requests (JWS Compact Serialization): <tt>openid4vp-v1-signed</tt></li>
<li>Multi-signed requests (JWS JSON Serialization): <tt>openid4vp-v1-multisigned</tt></li>
</ul>
</section>

<section anchor="dc_api_request"><name>Request</name>
<t>The Verifier MAY send a request, as defined in <xref target="vp_token_request"></xref>, to the DC API.</t>
<t>The following is a non-normative example of an unsigned OpenID4VP request (when advanced security features of OpenID4VP are not used) that can be sent over the DC API:</t>

<sourcecode type="js">{
  response_type: &quot;vp_token&quot;,
  response_mode: &quot;dc_api&quot;,
  nonce: &quot;n-0S6_WzA2Mj&quot;,
  client_metadata: {...},
  dcql_query: {...}
}
</sourcecode>
<t>Out of the Authorization Request parameters defined in <xref target="RFC6749"></xref> and <xref target="vp_token_request"></xref>, the following are supported with OpenID4VP over the W3C Digital Credentials API:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li><tt>client_id</tt></li>
<li><tt>response_type</tt></li>
<li><tt>response_mode</tt></li>
<li><tt>nonce</tt></li>
<li><tt>client_metadata</tt></li>
<li><tt>request</tt></li>
<li><tt>transaction_data</tt></li>
<li><tt>dcql_query</tt></li>
<li><tt>verifier_attestations</tt></li>
</ul>
<t>The <tt>client_id</tt> parameter MUST be omitted in unsigned requests defined in <xref target="unsigned_request"></xref>. The Wallet MUST ignore any <tt>client_id</tt> parameter that is present in an unsigned request.</t>
<t>Parameters defined by a specific Client Identifier Prefix (such as the <tt>trust_chain</tt> parameter for the OpenID Federation Client Identifier Prefix) are also supported over the W3C Digital Credentials API.</t>
<t>The <tt>client_id</tt> parameter MUST be present in signed requests defined in <xref target="signed_request"></xref>, as it communicates to the wallet which Client Identifier Prefix and Client Identifier to use when authenticating the client through verification of the request signature or retrieving client metadata.</t>
<t>The value of the <tt>response_mode</tt> parameter MUST be <tt>dc_api</tt> when the response is not encrypted and <tt>dc_api.jwt</tt> when the response is encrypted as defined in <xref target="response_encryption"></xref>. The Response Mode <tt>dc_api</tt> causes the Wallet to send the Authorization Response via the DC API. For Response Mode <tt>dc_api.jwt</tt>, the Wallet includes the <tt>response</tt> parameter, which contains an encrypted JWT encapsulating the Authorization Response, as defined in <xref target="response_encryption"></xref>.</t>
<t>In addition to the above-mentioned parameters, a new parameter is introduced for OpenID4VP over the W3C Digital Credentials API:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li><tt>expected_origins</tt>: REQUIRED when signed requests defined in <xref target="signed_request"></xref> are used with the Digital Credentials API (DC API). An array of strings, each string representing an Origin of the Verifier that is making the request. The Wallet can detect replay of the request from a malicious Verifier by comparing values in this parameter to the Origin. This parameter is not for use in unsigned requests and therefore a Wallet MUST ignore this parameter if it is present in an unsigned request.</li>
</ul>
<t>The transport of the request and Origin to the Wallet is platform-specific and is out of scope of OpenID4VP over the Digital Credentials API.</t>
<t>Additional request parameters MAY be defined and used with OpenID4VP over the DC API.</t>
<t>The Wallet MUST ignore any unrecognized parameters. For example, since the <tt>state</tt> parameter is not defined for the DC API, the Verifier cannot expect it to be included in the response.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="signed-and-unsigned-requests"><name>Signed and Unsigned Requests</name>
<t>Any OpenID4VP request compliant to this section of this specification can be used with the Digital Credentials API (DC API). Depending on the mechanism used to identify and authenticate the Verifier, the request can be signed or unsigned. This section defines signed and unsigned OpenID4VP requests for use with the DC API.</t>

<section anchor="unsigned_request"><name>Unsigned Request</name>
<t>The Verifier MAY send all the OpenID4VP request parameters as members in the request member passed to the API.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="signed_request"><name>Signed Request</name>
<t>The Verifier MAY send a signed request, for example, when identification and authentication of the Verifier is required.</t>
<t>The signed request allows the Wallet to authenticate the Verifier using one or more trust framework(s) in addition to the Web PKI utilized by the browser. An example of such a trust framework is the Verifier (RP) management infrastructure set up in the context of the eIDAS regulation in the European Union, in which case, the Wallet can no longer rely only on the web origin of the Verifier. This web origin MAY still be used to further strengthen the security of the flow. The external trust framework could, for example, map the Client Identifier to registered web origins.</t>
<t>The signed Request Object MAY contain all the parameters listed in <xref target="dc_api_request"></xref>, except <tt>request</tt>.</t>
<t>Verifiers SHOULD format signed Requests using JWS Compact Serialization but MAY use JWS JSON Serialization <xref target="RFC7515"></xref>) to cater for use cases described below.</t>

<section anchor="jws-compact-serialization"><name>JWS Compact Serialization</name>
<t>When the JWS Compact Serialization is used to send the request, the Verifier can convey only one Trust Framework, i.e., the Verifier should know which trust frameworks the wallet supports. All request parameters are encoded in a request object as defined in <xref target="vp_token_request"></xref> and the JWS object is used as the value of the <tt>request</tt> claim in the <tt>data</tt> element of the API call.</t>
<t>This is illustrated in the following non-normative example.</t>

<sourcecode type="js">{ request: &quot;eyJhbGciOiJF...&quot; }
</sourcecode>
<t>This is an example of the payload of a signed OpenID4VP request used with the W3C Digital Credentials API in conjunction with JWS Compact Serialization:</t>

<sourcecode type="json">{
  &quot;expected_origins&quot;: [
    &quot;https://origin1.example.com&quot;,
    &quot;https://origin2.example.com&quot;
  ],

  &quot;client_metadata&quot;: {
    &quot;jwks&quot;: {
      &quot;keys&quot;: [
        {
          &quot;kty&quot;: &quot;EC&quot;,
          &quot;crv&quot;: &quot;P-256&quot;,
          &quot;x&quot;: &quot;MKBCTNIcKUSDii11ySs3526iDZ8AiTo7Tu6KPAqv7D4&quot;,
          &quot;y&quot;: &quot;4Etl6SRW2YiLUrN5vfvVHuhp7x8PxltmWWlbbM4IFyM&quot;,
          &quot;use&quot;: &quot;enc&quot;,
          &quot;kid&quot;: &quot;1&quot;
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  &quot;response_type&quot;: &quot;vp_token&quot;,
  &quot;response_mode&quot;: &quot;dc_api&quot;,
  &quot;nonce&quot;: &quot;n-0S6_WzA2Mj&quot;,
  &quot;dcql_query&quot;: {...}
}
</sourcecode>
</section>

<section anchor="jws-json-serialization"><name>JWS JSON Serialization</name>
<t>The JWS JSON Serialization <xref target="RFC7515"></xref>) allows the Verifier to use multiple Client Identifiers and corresponding key material to protect the same request. This serves use cases where the Verifier requests Credentials belonging to different trust frameworks and, therefore, needs to authenticate in the context of those trust frameworks. It also allows the Verifier to add different attestations for each Client Identifier.</t>
<t>In this case, the following request parameters MUST be present in the protected header of the respective <tt>signature</tt> object in the <tt>signatures</tt> array defined in <xref target="RFC7515" sectionFormat="of" relative="#" section="7.2.1"></xref>:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li><tt>client_id</tt></li>
<li><tt>verifier_attestations</tt></li>
</ul>
<t>All other request parameters MUST be present in the <tt>payload</tt> element of the JWS object.</t>
<t>Below is a non-normative example of such a request:</t>

<sourcecode type="json">{
  &quot;payload&quot;: &quot;eyAiaXNzIjogImh0dHBzOi8...NzY4Mzc4MzYiIF0gfQ&quot;,
  &quot;signatures&quot;: [
    {
      &quot;protected&quot;: &quot;eyJhbGciOiAiRVMyNT..MiLCJraWQiOiAiMSJ9XX19fQ&quot;,
      &quot;signature&quot;: &quot;PFwem0Ajp2Sag...T2z784h8TQqgTR9tXcif0jw&quot;
    },
    {
      &quot;protected&quot;: &quot;eyJhbGciOiAiRVMyNTY...tpZCI6ICIxIn1dfX19&quot;,
      &quot;signature&quot;: &quot;irgtXbJGwE2wN4Lc...2TvUodsE0vaC-NXpB9G39cMXZ9A&quot;
    }
  ]
}
</sourcecode>
<t>Every object in the <tt>signatures</tt> structure contains the parameters and the signature specific to a particular Client Identifier. The signature is calculated as specified in section 5.1 of <xref target="RFC7515"></xref>.</t>
<t>The following is a non-normative example of a content of a decoded protected header:</t>

<section anchor="dc_api_response"><name>Response</name>
<t>Every OpenID4VP Authorization Request results in a response being provided through the Digital Credentials API (DC API). The response is an instance of the <tt>DigitalCredential</tt> interface, as defined in <xref target="W3C.Digital_Credentials_API"></xref>, and the OpenID4VP Authorization Response parameters as defined for the Response Type are represented as an object within the <tt>data</tt> attribute.</t>
<t>The security properties that are normally provided by the Client Identifier are achieved by binding the response to the Origin it was received from.</t>
<t>The audience for the response (for example, the <tt>aud</tt> value in a Key Binding JWT) MUST be the Origin, prefixed with <tt>origin:</tt>, for example <tt>origin:https://verifier.example.com/</tt>. This is the case even for signed requests. Therefore, when using OpenID4VP over the DC API, the Client Identifier is not used as the audience for the response.</t>

<section anchor="format_specific_parameters"><name>Credential Format Specific Parameters and Rules</name>
<t>OpenID for Verifiable Presentations is Credential Format agnostic, i.e., it is designed to allow applications to request and receive Presentations in any Credential Format. This section defines a set of Credential Format specific parameters and rules for some of the known Credential Formats. For the Credential Formats that are not mentioned in this specification, other specifications or deployments can define their own set of Credential Format specific parameters.</t>

<section anchor="w3c-verifiable-credentials"><name>W3C Verifiable Credentials</name>
<t>The following sections define the Credential Format specific parameters and rules for W3C Verifiable Credentials compliant to the <xref target="VC_DATA"></xref> specification and for W3C Verifiable Presenations of such Credentials.</t>
<t>If <tt>require_cryptographic_holder_binding</tt> is set to <tt>true</tt> in the Credential Query, the Wallet MUST return a Verifiable Presentation of a Verifiable Credential. Otherwise, a Verifiable Credential without Holder Binding MUST be returned.</t>

<section anchor="parameters-in-the-meta-parameter-in-credential-query"><name>Parameters in the <tt>meta</tt> parameter in Credential Query</name>
<t>The following is a W3C Verifiable Credentials specific parameter in the <tt>meta</tt> parameter in a Credential Query as defined in <xref target="credential_query"></xref>:</t>

<dl spacing="compact">
<dt><tt>type_values</tt>:</dt>
<dd>REQUIRED. An array of string arrays that specifies the fully expanded types (IRIs) after the <tt>@context</tt> was applied that the Verifier accepts to be presented in the Presentation. Each of the top-level arrays specifies one alternative to match the <tt>type</tt> values of the Verifiable Credential against. Each inner array specifies a set of fully expanded types that MUST be present in the <tt>type</tt> property of the Verifiable Credential, regardless of order or the presence of additional types.</dd>

When used in the context of W3C Verifiable Credentials, the <tt>claims_path</tt> parameter always matches on the root of Verifiable Credential (not the Verifiable Presentation). Examples are shown in the following subsections.</t>

<section anchor="verifier-metadata"><name>Verifier Metadata</name>
<t>The <tt>vp_formats</tt> parameter of the Verifier metadata MUST have the keys <tt>jwt_vc_json</tt> or <tt>ldp_vc</tt> (according to the format, as defined in <xref target="jwt_vc"></xref> and <xref target="ldp_vc"></xref>), and the value MUST be an object consisting of the following name/value pair:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li><tt>proof_type_values</tt>: OPTIONAL. A JSON array containing types of proofs that
the Verifier accepts to be used in the Verifiable Presentation, for example
<tt>[&quot;RsaSignature2018&quot;]</tt>.</li>

<t>AnonCreds is a Credential format defined as part of the Hyperledger Anoncreds project and formerly the Hyperledger Indy project <xref target="Hyperledger.AnonCreds"></xref>.</t>
<t>To be able to request AnonCreds, there needs to be a set of identifiers for Verifiable Credentials, Verifiable Presentations (&quot;proofs&quot; in AnonCreds terminology) and crypto schemes.</t>
<t>The identifier for the CL-signature crypto scheme used in the examples in this section is <tt>CLSignature2019</tt>.</t>

<section anchor="format-identifier"><name>Format Identifier</name>
<t>The Credential Format Identifier is <tt>ac_vp</tt> to request a Verifiable Presentation. Wallets MUST reject requests with this format identifier where <tt>require_cryptographic_holder_binding</tt> is set to <tt>false</tt>, as Presentations without Holder Binding are not supported for this format.</t>

<t>The AnonCreds Credential format only allows for a <tt>nonce</tt> that has to be exactly 80 bit long, whereas other Credential formats
allow for the different inputs to be signed over in a proof of possession for Cryptographic Holder Binding. For AnonCreds, everything that should be part of
the input to generate that proof MUST be part of the <tt>nonce</tt>. Currently, this specification does not support transaction data
for AnonCreds and only supports the <tt>nonce</tt> from the Authorization Request and an audience binding as inputs for
the proof generation. The audience binding MUST be the value of the Client Identifier, except for requests over the DC API where it MUST be
the Origin prefixed with <tt>origin:</tt>, as described in <xref target="dc_api_response"></xref>.</t>
<t>To compute to the <tt>nonce</tt> parameter that is used as an input for the Prove and Verify operations of AnonCreds, the <tt>nonce</tt> from the
Authorization Request must be concatenated with the audience binding (as defined above) and hashed using sha-256. The first
80 bits of that digest are then used as the <tt>nonce</tt> paramter for the AnonCreds proof. This computed nonce MUST then be used as nonce (also called n_1) for
the Presentation generation and verification as defined in sections 9.6 and 9.7 of <xref target="Hyperledger.AnonCreds"></xref>.</t>

<t>ISO/IEC 18013-5:2021 <xref target="ISO.18013-5"></xref> defines a mobile driving license (mDL) Credential in the mobile document (mdoc) format. Although ISO/IEC 18013-5:2021 <xref target="ISO.18013-5"></xref> is specific to mobile driving licenses (mDLs), the Credential format can be utilized with any type of Credential (or mdoc document types). The ISO/IEC 23220 series has extracted components from ISO/IEC 18013-5:2021 <xref target="ISO.18013-5"></xref> and ISO/IEC TS 18013-7 <xref target="ISO.18013-7"></xref> that are common across document types to facilitate the profiling of the specification for other document types. The core data structures are shared between ISO/IEC 18013-5:2021 <xref target="ISO.18013-5"></xref>, ISO/IEC 23220-2 <xref target="ISO.23220-2"></xref>, ISO/IEC 23220-4 <xref target="ISO.23220-4"></xref> which are encoded in CBOR and secured using COSE_Sign1.</t>
<t>The Credential Format Identifier for Credentials in the mdoc format is <tt>mso_mdoc</tt>.</t>
<t>ISO/IEC TS 18013-7 Annex B <xref target="ISO.18013-7"></xref> and ISO/IEC 23220-4 <xref target="ISO.23220-4"></xref> Annex C define a profile of OpenID4VP for requesting and presenting Credentials in the mdoc format.</t>
<t><xref target="ISO.18013-7"></xref> defines the following elements:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>Rules for the <tt>presentation_definition</tt> Authorization Request parameter and the <tt>presentation_submission</tt> Authorization Response parameter (which were supported until draft -25 of this specification)</li>
<li>Wallet invocation using the <tt>mdoc-openid4vp://</tt> custom URI scheme.</li>
<li>Required Wallet and Verifier Metadata parameters and their values when OpenID4VP is used with the <tt>mdoc-openid4vp://</tt> custom URI scheme.
The <tt>SessionTranscript</tt> and <tt>Handover</tt> CBOR structure when the invocation does not use the DC API. Also see <xref target="non-dc-api-invocation"></xref>.</li>
<li>Additional restrictions on Authorization Request and Authorization Response parameters to ensure compliance with ISO/IEC TS 18013-7 <xref target="ISO.18013-7"></xref> and ISO/IEC 23220-4 <xref target="ISO.23220-4"></xref>. For instance, to comply with ISO/IEC TS 18013-7 <xref target="ISO.18013-7"></xref>, only the same-device flow is supported, the <tt>request_uri</tt> Authorization Request parameter is required, and the Authorization Response has to be encrypted.</li>

<section anchor="transaction-data"><name>Transaction Data</name>
<t>It is RECOMMENDED that each transaction data type defines a data element (<tt>NameSpace</tt>, <tt>DataElementIdentifier</tt>, <tt>DataElementValue</tt>) to be used to return the processed transaction data. Additionally it is RECOMMENDED that it specifies the processing rules, potentially including any hash function to be applied, and the expected resulting structure.</t>
<t>Some document types support some transaction data (<xref target="transaction_data"></xref>) to be protected using mdoc authentication, as part of the <tt>DeviceSigned</tt> data structure <xref target="ISO.18013-5"></xref>. In those cases, the specifications of these document types include which transaction data types are supported, and the issuer includes the relevant data elements in the <tt>KeyAuthorizations</tt>. If a Wallet receives a request with a <tt>transaction_data</tt> type whose data element is unauthorized, the Wallet MUST reject the request due to an unsupported transaction data type.</t>

<section anchor="transaction-data-1"><name>Transaction Data</name>
<t>It is RECOMMENDED that each transaction data type defines a top level claim parameter to be used in the Key Binding JWT to return the processed transaction data. Additionally, it is RECOMMENDED that it specifies the processing rules, potentially including any hash function to be applied, and the expected resulting structure.</t>
<t>The transaction data mechanism requires use of an SD-JWT VC with Cryptographic Holder Binding. Wallets MUST reject requests with transaction data types that have the <tt>require_cryptographic_holder_binding</tt> parameter set to <tt>false</tt>.</t>

<section anchor="a-profile-of-transaction-data-in-sd-jwt-vc"><name>A Profile of Transaction Data in SD-JWT VC</name>
<t>The following is one profile that can be included in a transaction data type specification:</t>

<li><tt>transaction_data_hashes_alg</tt>: OPTIONAL. Array of strings each representing a hash algorithm identifier, one of which MUST be used to calculate hashes in <tt>transaction_data_hashes</tt> response parameter. The value of the identifier MUST be a hash algorithm value from the &quot;Hash Name String&quot; column in the IANA &quot;Named Information Hash Algorithm&quot; registry <xref target="IANA.Hash.Algorithms"></xref> or a value defined in another specification and/or profile of this specification. If this parameter is not present, a default value of <tt>sha-256</tt> MUST be used. To promote interoperability, implementations MUST support the sha-256 hash algorithm.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><t>The Key Binding JWT in the response includes the following top level parameters:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li><tt>transaction_data_hashes</tt>: Array of hashes, where each hash is calculated using a hash function over the data in the strings received in the <tt>transaction_data</tt> request parameter. Each hash value ensures the integrity of, and maps to, the respective transaction data object. If <tt>transaction_data_hashes_alg</tt> was specified in the request, the hash function MUST be one of its values. If <tt>transaction_data_hashes_alg</tt> was not specified in the request, the hash function MUST be <tt>sha-256</tt>.</li>
<li><tt>transaction_data_hashes_alg</tt>: REQUIRED when this parameter was present in the <tt>transaction_data</tt> request parameter. String representing the hash algorithm identifier used to calculate hashes in <tt>transaction_data_hashes</tt> response parameter.</li>
